CHAPTER VI.
DISEASES OF INFANTS.
INFANTS are particularly liable to some affections,
which are worthy of notice.
SLEEPLESSNESS.
When this occurs in infants and young children,
disease is clearly indicated. Diet of an improper
nature, particularly if heat and restlessness be present, is often the cause, and the green stools, the flatulence, and swollen condition of the bowels testify to
this. In these cases Chamomilla will succeed, provided this has not been given to excess previously:
if so, then Coffaea.* Chamomilla will be useful if
the crying is caused by ear-ache.
* Coffee taken by the mother is often the cause of the sleeplessness of the child. Mothers, while suckling, should never take
Coffee. Mothers should suckle on cocoa, and I have the testimony of mothers who have so suckled, and they state that they
found with COCOA without BEER, they produced quite sufficient
milk, and the children suckled with such diet, were in better
health, than those suckled on previous occasions when beer and
coffee and tea formed the liquid part of their diet. Reference
has been made to this before.
