or ointments. Friction, if exciting the absorbents to
act, does not ALTER the diseased state, which caused
the enlargement, and often this diseased state is thus,
as it were, forced to effect either glandular structures
in the lungs, and thus pulmonary consumption is induced: or glandular structures in the abdominal viscera, and thus mesenteric disease with its miserable
train of emaciation, effusion on the brain and death,
are developed.
Another point worthy of remark is, that these
swellings should NOT be cut open. Every surgeon
thinks he must be a surgeon and use his lancet.
He is sure to make a scar and not a cure: whereas
if the abscess is made to discharge itself, it leaves no
scar, and the cure is likely to be permanent. The
same remarks apply to opening the glandular swelling
by caustic.
Another evil resulting from the scars thus induced,
is that the structure thereby (i. e. by the process
which takes place in healing the wound made by the
lancet or by the caustic,) is so altered, that the part
becomes a source of pain, from changes of weather
affecting this structure of a texture different from
the natural.
