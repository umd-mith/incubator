fever generally under the same circumstances, as the
same train of symptoms may occur at any age, from
infancy up to puberty.
YELLOW FEVER.
This fever is classed with remittents; although
its general characteristics are similar, it differs widely
in degree of severity. At one time it shows a very
mild aspect, at others the most alarming malignancy.
It travels through all the grades of fever, from the
simple continued to the lowest congestive typhus,
where there are no reactive energies, vomiting of a
dark coffee-ground substance, and the deep yellowness of the eyes and skin distinguishes this fever.
Antimony Tart. is the leading remedy in this disease, one grain in a tumbler half full of water: give
one teaspoonfull of this every ten to fifteen or thirty
minutes.
Veratrum, as in remittents.
Opium, if the patient is comatose.
Muriatic Acid, if there is great prostration.
Stinmlants. Brandy and Wine, if there is great
congestion, with no power of reaction.
INTERMITTENT FEVER.
This form of fever usually occurs in marshy districts or new lands, just exposed to the rays of the
sun after clearing them of trees, or turning up the
rich soil of prairies, where vegetation has been decaying undisturbed for centuries.
