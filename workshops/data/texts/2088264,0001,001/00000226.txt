Thus a disease which has its origin in irritation or
surfeit of the stomach, and only produces diseased
action of the functions of the brain by sympathy,
becomes an absolute disease of the structure of the
brain, and a tedious illness, if not death, is the result.  Therefore, the means which are always at
hand should be immediately resorted to. If the child
can be induced to drink freely of warm water, either
with or without a little molasses, it will often bring
about vomiting, if aided by the oiled feather, as
above. If these means should not answer, Ipecacuanha julap, which is made by mixing about as much
of the pulv. Ipecac. as will lay upon a twenty-five
cent piece into a paste with a spoonful of molasses,
and to this add one wineglass full of warm water;
one teaspoonful of this must be given every five minutes until vomiting comes on. If you have reason
to believe that the food has passed into the bowels,
an injection will be the most appropriate remedy.
In the mean time, or as soon as this mechanical cause
is removed, the appropriate remedies for restoring the
disturbed vital action to its healthy condition must
be resorted to, as directed in the text. One more
precaution may be worthy of attention. Nurses or
parents are very apt to keep a child upright after they
have had a convulsion, or while their feet are in the
water; this is liable to bring on faintness, and consequently convulsions. From this cause, therefore,
the patient should be allowed to repose in a horizontal position, and perfect quiet observed; at the
same time some nourishment or stimulants may be
given.
