neither rain water nor distilled water can be obtained,
common water, boiled two hours, and poured out while
boiling, and allowed to stand in an earthenware
vessel till cold, can be used. The solution should
always be made in a new bottle, with a new well-fitting cork; or if the bottle has been used before for
homoeopathic medicines, it should be washed with
water, renewed four times, well drained, and then
heated to dryness in an oven or before the fire. All
bottles, which have been used for the medicines, as
prescribed under the old system, must not, on any
account, be used. The medicines should be kept in
the dark. The cork should be inserted directly the
medicine has been removed from the bottle.
Rules for administration in acute diseases.
In acute diseases, the plan I generally adopt is to
dissolve three to four globules* of the medicine indicated, in four spoonsful (either tablespoonful or teaspoonful, according to the age of the person,) of
water; give two spoonsful at once, and repeat generally every eight hours, sometimes every four hours,
Generally in acute diseases there is more or less
of febrile heat. ACONITUM is the medicine most
peculiarly appropriate to such a condition, and hence,
in perhaps seven cases out of ten of acute diseases,
aconitum will be the remedy best suited to give at
first, dissolved as directed.
* The globules are impregnated with the medicinal agent. I
generally use the globules impregnated with the medicinal solution
at its highest dilution; usually marked 30. To adults, sometimes,
the globules at a less dilution, marked 12.
