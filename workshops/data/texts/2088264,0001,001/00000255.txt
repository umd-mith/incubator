ment could have been arrested at the outset, would
not have appeared.
In these derangements, Antimonium    Crudum,
Bryonia, or Pulsatilla, will arrest the progress:
antimonium crudum, if there are risings, nausea,
and feeling as if the person must be sick; bryonia,
if there is gastric fever, with shivering and cold;
and pulsatilla, if the derangement has been brought
about by fat foods, and more particularly by eating
pork.
EXPOSURE TO COLD OR WET,
commonly called taking cold, is a frequent source
of inconvenience and of danger in the progress
of diseases, and a frequent cause of diseased states
themselves.
Nux Vomica (as will be seen from the treatment
of Catarrh, pp. 87, 88,) taken at once, will often
arrest the progress of the symptoms, usually occurring after such exposure.
If, however, the taking cold is attended with a
sense of sufocation and nausea, then Ipecacuanha:
if followed with pain and shedding of tears, Cofe a:
if followed by a copious discharge from the nose,
and by the loss of smell and of taste, Pulsatilla:
if followed by relaxation of the bowels and thickening of the water, then Dulcamara: if followed
by. relaxation of the bowels and griping, then
Chamomilla.
