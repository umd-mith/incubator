Four hundred and seventy-seven children died in one
year, in the thirty-four metropolitan unions, from
teething.
The best plan to prevent disease affecting the head
in connection with teething, is to keep the head cool,
and, to realize this, caps should cease to be worn
directly the hair becomes a little abundant. Another
excellent plan is to rub the backbone every night.
This, for the benefits resulting in other respects,
should be continued till the child is six or seven years
old.
Dr. Hering remarks, " When the teeth approach,
the gums are broader, as if angular, and tickle and
itch, are whitish, particularly on the edges; the
mouth is, at the same time, hot; the child restless,
especially at night, has flushes of heat, succeeded by
paleness; puts everything to the mouth, in order to
bite it, and sometimes bites the nipple hard when
suckling."
The well-known phenomenon of drivelling at the
mouth is another symptom: and one which shows
the direction of action to the jaws and the parts
neighboring in developing the teeth, and, at the same
time, the means which nature adopts to relieve the
irritation.
Another means, which nature seems to adopt to
relieve the irritation, is a slight relaxation of the
bowels.
These two augmented actions, namely, the increased discharge of saliva, and the increased action
of the bowels, need not any medical treatment, unless they become too severe: then Mercurius will be
serviceable, followed by Sulphur.
