symptoms threaten, the Rhus Toxicodendron is useful: aconite having been previously used.
When the head and the scalp are affected, the
physician's aid must be sought. In reference to external applications in erysipelas, dry applications only
are to' be used. Rye meal is the best of these.
Fine powder from wheaten starch abates the itching.
MILIARY FEVER, (MILIARIA.)
This eruptive disease, consisting of small transparent elevations, about the size of millet seed, of
the skin, attended with fever, great anxiety, and
restlessness, and symptoms indicating affection of
the chest, is, when unconnected with other diseases,
which it very frequently is, treated best by Aconite,
followed by Coffiea, when there is much nervous
excitability.
When the head is affected, and delirium supervenes, then Belladonna is preferable to Coffmea.
If there is diarrhoea, and particularly when undue
warmth in clothing has induced the attack, Chamomilla is generally very beneficial.
NETTLE-RASH, (URTICARIA.)
This eruptive disease, cons'isting in the appearance
of red pimples, often presenting a white spot in the
centre, and attended with itching, or a fine stinging
suddenly appearing, and   suddenly disappearing,
from one part to appear on another, is well known.
