A third malady of the skin, affecting adults as
well as children, may be designated, from the prominent symptom,
ITCHINGS.
Little colorless knotty bodies, appearing more particularly at the nape of the neck, on the bosom, at the
inner part of the thighs, itch, and being scratched,
become red, discharge at their tops, and, in a few
hours, twelve to twenty-four, form minute white, yellowish, or dusky crusts or scabs.
The itching and the inflammation are augmented
by scratching, stimulating drinks, exercise, at the
monthly periods, and in the evening. Variations in
the weather often occasion a return.
Sometimes the irritation is very extended; the skin
of the whole neck being affected.
