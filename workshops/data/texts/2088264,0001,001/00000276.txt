CHAPTER II.
INSECT    STINGS.    BITES OF    REPTILES.
BITE OF A MAD DOG.
THE principal remedies are the smell of camphor,
and washing with cold water. Holding the injured
part near the fire is good.
Honey-rubbed on the stung part is good, having
previously extracted, as far as possible, the sting.
In America lemon juice is used to mosquito bites,
with great success: it might be used in stings in this
country.
If bitten by a reptile not venomous, rub salt or
gunpowder into the wound.
If bitten by a venomous reptile, tie tightly, a few
inches length above the wound, a cord of any description, suck the wound out at once, but suck it
well and long, stroking with the hand the part
while you suck, and opening the wound as wide as
possible.
After the sucking, rub kitchen salt or gunpowder
well into the wound, and take immediately some
salt or gunpowder.
When bitten by a mad dog, do as above directed.
