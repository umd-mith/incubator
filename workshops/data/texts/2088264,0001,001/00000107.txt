Bryonia has many symptoms, which render it
very valuable in coughs: indeed it will be noticed in
inflammation of the lungs: its symptoms approach
much to Nux Vomica, but its peculiarities are, that
generally chilliness preponderates, and that the temper is extremely irritable. The pains produced by it
are sticking, stitch-like pains, and the pains are felt
deep in the chest.
HOOPING OR WHOOPING COUGH, (PERTUSSIS.)
This spasmodic cough, without physic, will often
wear itself out in four or five months; with physic,
under the old system, will continue much longer;
and this, on these grounds, that the physic complicates the disease, and produces a weakness of the
general constitution.
Under homceopathic treatment it is often cured in
three to four weeks; sometimes in two weeks, sometimes in a few days.
When hooping-cough is prevalent and children
begin to cough, give one or other of the remedies already detailed (pp. 96 to 100) as suitable to cough,
selecting the one most nearly allied to the symptoms
of the existing cough.
Aconite will be serviceable principally at the commencement, but also at any period where the symptoms hereafter detailed with fever are present:
namely,'when the cough is dry (1. p. 96,) whistling,
attended with burning (7. p. 97) in the windpipe, the
child putting his hand to the throat at the situation
of the windpipe; and when there is fever (14. p. 98)
the aconite should be given immediately, and repeated
as the symptoms may indicate.
