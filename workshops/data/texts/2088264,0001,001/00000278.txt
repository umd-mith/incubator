CHAPTER III.
FOREIGN BODIES, IN DIFFERFNT PARTS
OF THE BODY.
THE treatment of the eye when foreign bodies
enter it, has been explained.
Sometimes insects get into the EAR: if so, drop
oil into the ear, until the insect becomes visible, and
with a piece of paper rolled up, pull it out. But if
the body be a pea, or anything that swells and which
cannot be removed thus, then take a hair pin, bend
it at the end to an obtuse angle, so that the upper
part of the pin may form a knee, like a spoon, and
push the pointed ends into a cork: place yourself
behind the ear, pull the ear with one hand upwards
and at the same time from the head; then dip the
instrument in oil, and holding the bend in the instrument close to the inside of the ear, push it in so as
to get it around and behind the object; then lift it a
little, and the body will fall into the bend of the pinSometimes pointed things get into the ear. A
case treated, related in the tract on Arnica Monta
