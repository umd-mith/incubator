improves.
If chloride of lime solution is not at hand, mix
some vinegar with an equal quantity of water, and
sprinkle the face with it: and hold a sponge, dipped
in vinegar, before the nose and the mouth.
During this time the patient should be rubbed
with hot flannel. If the face has been sprinkled,
wipe it dry after a little while: then rub it with hot

may be brushed a little with a stiff brush.
Be not too hasty, but proceed gently, and continue
patiently. Life sometimes will not return till after
three or four hours.
If the patient, apparently dead, does not breathe
at all, it is useless to hold a sponge before his nose;
only try from time to time, by holding a light feather
there, whether his breathing has recommenced.
Blow breath occasionally into his mouth, which is
best done by a person inhaling as much as he can,
and then placing his mouth on that of the apparently
dead (whose nose should be held shut), and blowing

rising thereby, let the breath go out of itself, and repeat the operation. If the breath will not come out
again of itself, place a towel around the breast, and
after the breath has been blown in, pull it gently.
Thus by keeping up an artificial respiration, a person
apparently dead may often be restored again, but he
who undertakes the operation should himself be
healthy and have a clean breath, and either drink or
