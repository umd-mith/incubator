Infants are troubled oftentimes very much with
HICCOUGH.
This is generally relieved by laying the child
warm on the mother's breast: a little lump of sugar,
as much as will cover the blade of a penknife, or a
little sweetened water will remove this affection.
Treacle is to be avoided, this producing acidity and
phlegm.
REGURGITATION OR RETURN OF THE MILK.
Some infants seem particularly subject to this.
They should be allowed to suckle less long each time.
If the return of the milk amounts to vomiting, then
Ipecacuanha can be used.
Another disease of infants is
EXCORIATION.

For a description of this, see p. 34.
