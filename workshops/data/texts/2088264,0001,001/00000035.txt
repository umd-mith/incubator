irritation, and thereby effectually resist the operation
of the remedy.

find out the remedy recorded in connection therewith, which corresponds most exactly in its symptoms
to those of the disease.
It does not require that the similarity should be
perfect: better if it is: but if the prominent, the
majority of the symptoms agree, then give the medicine.

no use to take the medicines when their position subjects them, of

the mental excitement, and may have some of the injurious effects
prevented.
