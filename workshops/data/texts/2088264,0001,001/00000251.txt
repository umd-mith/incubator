AN INTENSE DESIRE, when ABSENT from home to RETURN HOME, called NOSTALGIA,
is a frequent cause of bodily disease.
This &amp; attended generally with redness of cheeks
and sleeplessness.
Capsicum is the best remedy.
UNHAPPY LOVE WITH JEALOUSY
is often the cause of bodily disease.
Note.- It is one of the peculiar features of homoeopathic practice, that the moral symptoms are so
highly important; in fact,, in some cases, deciding
the use of a remedy. Precision is therefore one essential in successful homceopathic practice; and if
precision is deemed a mark of a scientific mind,
surely homoeopathy, which requires such precision,
is to be regarded as possessing a scientific character.
