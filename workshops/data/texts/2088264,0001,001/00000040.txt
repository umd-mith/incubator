*When the surrounding parts swell, are red and
tender, and the little sufferer scratches and is restless, Aconite* can be administered, followed on the
second day, when the restlessness and the inflammatory symptoms are subdued, by the Viola Tricolor.
The viola tricolor not affording relief, Sulphur will
be useful.
[If it is brought on by variations of temperature,
accompanied with symptoms of cold, give Dulcamara
in the usual way. If there is much itching, with
watery discharge, Rhus. Tox. Hep. Sulp., if hoarseness attends the cold, Graph. Arsenicum may also be
required. - Ed.]
No external application but a little hair powder or
weak soap water should be used.
When depending upon constitutional tendency,
and relief not being attained by these means, the
physician must be consulted.
Another malady of the skin in children is
EXCORIATION.
This takes place at the folds of the skin, particularly in infancy.
Cleanliness, by the use of lukewarm water, and in
drying the parts, not by rubbing, but the free use of
the common drying t powder, are often sufficient;
* For the general conditions under which Aconite is useful, see
Introduction.
t This powder should be made of the flower of wheat, and not of
that of the potato.
