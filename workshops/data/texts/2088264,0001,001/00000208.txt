CHAPTER IV.

DISEASED      STATES    AFTER     DELIVERY.
CONSTIPATION, NO. 1.
Do not be troubled about the bowels not acting.
Nature is busy restoring the natural condition of the
womb and the genital organs: all her powers are
occupied in that direction and therefore she leaves
the intestines. When she has effected her purposes,
the intestines will act of themselves.
Remember this - that ACUTE diseases, injlammation of the bowels, puerperal fever, and the CHRONIC
diseases, the bearing down of the womb, the inability
of retaining water, which so much trouble women
who have borne children, are, in most cases, the
consequences of the purging system.
About the fifth or sixth day after confinement the
bowels rgenerally act.  If more than a week occur
without an action, take two globules of BRYONIA;
and, if no action take place in twelve hours, take
another globule of bryonia; and, if in twelve hours
after that there is no action, use a lavement of about
three quarters of a pint of warm water, if friction
over the bowels is not effectual.
