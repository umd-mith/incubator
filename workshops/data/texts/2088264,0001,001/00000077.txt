If the eye is inflamed from anything in it, common
sense dictates the removal of the body, the bathing
with warm water, and then Aconite will prevent the
inflammation: Sulphur may be used after Aconite.
When the eye has become inflamed from a bruise,
Arnica is very useful.
INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE FROM BODIES ENTERING
THE EYE.
Often a portion of lime or some other body gets
between the eye and the lids.
Much irritation is occasioned, the white of the eye
becomes affected, and a pain is felt in the whole of
the eye; a discharge of tears takes place, and the eye
becomes sensitive to light. An attempt should be
made to remove the foreign body, and, after its
removal, Aconite should be administered. Sometimes
the foreign body cannot be removed on account of
the excessive sensibility of the eye, then aconite being
administered will subdue the sensibility, and render
it possible to remove the body in the eye.
A modification of this is that produced by a small
insect of some kind entering the eye and stinging it.
It is called sometimes
BLIGHT.
Considerable redness and pain are present; Aconite
here acts immediately in relieving the irritation.
