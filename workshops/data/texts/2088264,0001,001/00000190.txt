PART II.
CHAPTER I.
THE CONDUCT DURING THE STATE OF
PREGNANCY
A PREGNANT woman occupies a position of the
highest interest. She bears about'with her a living
being, whose future physical, and, it may be added,
intellectual, moral, and animal condition is dependent,
in a great measure, upon the conduct and the state
of mind, which she pursues and cultivates during the
period of pregnancy.
The mental and moral influence of the pregnant
female on her offspring, is a subject too wide to come
within the limits of this work. The physical influence may be noticed.
To enable a mother to realize for her child that
excellence of constitution, a child has a right to expect to receive from its parent, she must pay attention during her pregnancy to her DIET, her EXERCISE,
and her DRESS.
