the patient is undecided, and careless at first; he
hesitates to express himself, and stops short where a sentence or word is half uttered. A feeling of weariness in
the back, and if the patient is still walking about, he
stops, hesitates, and feels uncertain what to do. The
eyes look dull; pupils are dilated, and not as sensible to light as usual; the pulse is generally slow at
first, then rapid and irregular; the respiration, which
at first is slow with an occasional deep sigh, becomes
rapid, short and weak. He often complains of a
great load in the chest, or about the heart. As the
disease advances, and the delirium increases, he picks
the bed-clothes, and lies upon his back; with a tendency to slide towards the foot of the bed. When
the disease is very malignant, small ulcers or sores,
at first resembling flea-bites, are scattered over the
surface of the body; these become purple, and
spread into sloughing ulcers, called petechie.
When petechiae does not appear, the skin, particularly over the abdomen, becomes brownish and
mottled.
T r e a t men t. - Where the disease is light, and
evidently superinduced by scanty or improper food,
generous diet, rest, and if there is much prostration,
brandy and water will quickly restore the patient.
Carbonate of Ammonia, one grain, a powder the
size of a pea, every hour, will answer as a substitute
for the brandy, or may be alternated with it. If
there should be nausea, some diarrhoea, and great prostration, Veratrum, one drop in water every half
hour, will be necessary. If this should not relieve,
Stibium, every half hour, must be given.
