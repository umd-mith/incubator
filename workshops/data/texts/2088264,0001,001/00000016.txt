cus, and a cathartic, by removing this, leaves the delicate
mucous tissue a sure prey to the succeeding doses of medicine which often follow. As the second epoch approaches,
the gums begin to look red, and swell slightly, the child
bites and discharges saliva, is restless, and the eyes are
slightly inflamed, or at least the inner surface of the lids,
and the vessels of the conjunctiva are fuller and more numerous than has been before noticed.
The great disproportion between the size of the brain
and other organs, during the first and second epoch, renders diseases of the brain very frequent. All opiates increase this tendency and should be studiously avoided.
Through the whole course of my practice, allopathic as
well as homceopathic, I have unhesitatingly condemned the
introduction of opium into the nursery, in any form,
whether elixor paregoric, cordials, dovers powder or
any other, as directly tending to produce not only many of

The clothing should be carefully attended to, while
every precaution should be taken to avoid cold and damp
air; free exposure to the air when it is of a mild and

warmth of the head, will not only make the child uncomfortable by the irritation constantly kept up, but they are

then tepid water, during the first month, and as the infant
gains strength, gradually passing on to cold water, with
gentle friction, is conducive to the health and strength of
the infant. When cold bathing is practised, it should consist in rapid immersion, when a beneficial reaction will
ensue, and a fine glow will pass over the surface, whereas
continuing the child in the water, even for a minute, would
