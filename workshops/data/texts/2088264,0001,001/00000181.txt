very gently but constantly, with warm cloths, giving
immediately an injection of opium, ten to twenty
globules dissolved in half a pint of water, well shaken,

inside. From time to time a small mirror should be
held before the mouth and the nose, to see if breath
begins to escape, whether he opens his eyes, and
sees, or the pupils move at all. Lay warm cloths,
hot stones, wrapped in cloths, on the feet, between
the legs, on the back, the sides, and under the armpits. If no alteration appear in one or two hours,

pint of water, put some of it in the mouth, lay two
or three drops on the tongue, or in the nose, and
give the remainder in small injections. If the injection goes forward, then take a longer pipe and keep
to the anus: after withdrawing it, place the thumb
upon it for five to ten minutes, and see whether the
injection remains. In addition, a healthy person
may stroke with the palm of his right hand, keeping
the hand some inches from the body, very quickly,
from the top of the head to the toes: at each fresh
stroke turning himself about, and carrying the hand
in a wide circle again to the head.
