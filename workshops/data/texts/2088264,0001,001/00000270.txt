vomited is of a red or green color, when the patient
has a metallic, coppery, or salty taste in his mouth:
in general when you suspect that he may have swallowed verdigris, red led, vermilion, corrosive sublimate, &amp;c. If the patient find relief from the taking
of white of eggs, continue it, and should he be
afflicted with diarrhoea and pain in the anus, give
him an injection of the water from white of eggs.
Another very important remedy, in most cases of
poisoning, and applicable when white of eggs seems
ineffective, is soap water. But for this purpose you
must not take soft soap, nor any resinous hard soap,
except in cases of the utmost need, nor any soap which
is stained red, as this is done with poisonous ingredients, but the best white Castile soap.  Dissolve
this in hot water, and let the patient drink a cup full
of it warm, every three or four minutes.
Soap water will only prove injurious when the poison itself was alkaline, or lye, or fretting-stone, potashes, soda, salts of tartar, oil of tartar, spirits of sal
ammoniac, sal ammoniac itself, English smelling
salts, salts of hartshorn, lime, slacked or burned,
barytes (often sold as ratsbane, under a pretence of
its not being injurious to the people, because it is not
arsenic); salts of tartar, which is often mistaken for
tartar emetic, or tartarus tartarisatus. When the
substance which the patient vomited does not smell
sour but soapy; when blue paper which had become
reddish from having been drawn through vinegar, is
turned blue again by it; when it begins to foam upon
aqua fortis, or oil of vitriol, or sulphuric or muriatic
acid being dropped into it--in all these cases you
must not use soap water, but substitute vinegar.
