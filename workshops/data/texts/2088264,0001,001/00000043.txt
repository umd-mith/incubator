ends of the fingers at the nail; being attended often
with severe pain, and ending very frequently in suppuration.
Mercurius is the best remedy in suppuration.
If in the course of eight hours after taking the
mercurius, two globules as a dose, no improvement
be apparent, use Aconite and Hepar Sulphuris, as
recommended for acute diseases, in the Introduction;
this will often prevent suppuration and the loss of the
nail, and even, if not preventing suppuration, the
process of suppuration will be rendered less troublesome and painful.
A poultice should be employed: Dr. Hering recommends, if the pains are acute, to let a fresh egg be
opened at the thick end and to thrust the finger into
it, and let it remain there till the pain abate.
[Although this disease is sometimes superficial;
confined to the skin and cellular texture and glands
about the nail, it is improperly classed with skin
diseases. More frequently the worst forms are deep
seated next the bone, and an incision down to the
seat of the disease is the only sure means of arresting
a very painful malady.   Aconite and Mercury,
internally, and a soothing poultice externally, steadily
and patiently persevered in, are the only sure mean:
of relief.- Ed.]
When suppuration is taking place, Hepar Sulphuris aids nature most effectually.
Should the whitlow again threaten, then Silica
may be employed, alternating this with Sulphur.
The north pole of the magnet, applied to the whitlow for a minute or two, has been found to be serviceable.
