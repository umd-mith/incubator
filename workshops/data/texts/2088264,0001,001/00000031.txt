DOMESTIC HOM(EOPATHY.
INTRODUCTION.
IT seems proper, as introductory to this little
treatise, to make a few remarks upon
The rules for administering the medicines.
There are three methods of administering homoeopathic remedies; first, by smelling; second, by putting globule or globules of the medicine upon the
tongue; and the third, by taking the medicine dissolved in water.
For persons very susceptible, smelling the medicine is deemed sufficient: for persons less susceptible, the medicine is placed upon the tongue: and
for others, the medicine is given in solution: which
last is the form most frequently employed.
Generally speaking, solution in water is to be preferred.  Filtered rain water, or what is better, pure,
distilled water,* constitutes the best vehicle.  When
* By pure distilled water is meant water obtained by the distillation of water: not water that is distilled over in the preparation
of essential oils. Any person can make a little distilled water by
putting some water in a retort, and then having connected this retort by its neck with a receiver; the receiver being kept cold by
the dropping of cold water, the steam, produced by the application
of a lighted spirit lamp to the retort, will be condensed in the receiver.
