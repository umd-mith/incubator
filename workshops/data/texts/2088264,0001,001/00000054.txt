peared and it retrocedes, the danger is great: Bryonia then must be used. This is particularly useful,
where symptoms of inflammation of the chest appear.
If,the glands under or before the ears swell,
Arnica will be useful.
Another eruptive disease affecting the skin, and
influencing powerfully the general constitution, is
SCARLET FEVER, OR SCARLATINA.
A sore throat is often the only warning of the attack; and this affection of the throat is the condition
with which the fatality of the disease is associated.
The skin in scarlet fever is of a bright red color,
is smooth and glossy: the redness gradually dying
away in the surrounding skin: pressure produces a
whiteness, disappearing on the removal of the pressure.
The eruption begins generally on the face, and
other exposed parts: being fully developed in about
five days.
When the eruption passes into desquamation (actual scales being disengaged from the skin,) the fever
ceases.
Belladonna is the sheet anchor in this disease, and
should be administered when the disease appears.
If, however, the throat is much charged with viscid
muscus, and ulceration and swelling are present,
Mercury is absolutely necessary: the alternate, day
by day, use of Belladonna and Mercurius, I have
found decidedly useful in some of the worst cases.
