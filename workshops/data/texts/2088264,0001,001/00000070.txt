of a Homceopathic physician, with Helleb. where
there is stupor, disposition in the child to lie down,
trembling of the limbs, motions involuntary, eyes,
insensible to light, pupils dilated, swallows hastily,
strikes about, easily starts, cries out, pulse intermitted. The other remedies are Mercury and Arsenicum, and may also be resorted to.-     Ed.]
No parent is, however, justified in treating such an
affection; the physician's aid must be sought.
Another well-known affection of the head is that
called
HEADACHE, (CEPHALALGIA.)
Headache is generally a symptom         of other diseases, more particularly of affection of the stomach:
still there are some headaches sufficiently uncomplicated as to admit of treatment as distinct.
Numerous remedies are applicable to the different
forms of headache: the choice will be aided by a
careful examination of the following tables.*       As,
* When the numbers are put down in a column, it indicates that
the remedy has or produces, and consequently will be curative of
the symytom, with which that number is connected in the column
where it first occurs. The number saves the repetition of the
symptom; the symptom is however repeated, when the same does
not require many words. Thus a symptom is enumerated in the
first or any other column, and it is numbered: if the same number
is found in the next or any other column, such number, so placed,
indicates that the symptom identified with that number in the
column, in which it first occurred, belongs also to the medicine or
medicines at the head of the other column or columns in which
the number is repeated, and that consequently such remedy will
cure that in conjunction with the other symptoms in the column.
