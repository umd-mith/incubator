These glands from cold, from atmospheric changes,
and as puberty approaches, become enlarged, and are
often very troublesome.
[Theparotid glands swell during scarlet fever, from
the above causes, and from contagion; when, from
the latter cause, it properly constitutes mumps, which
is characterized by the following symptoms: soreness, with slight fullness at the angle of the jaw, with
some general heat, and pain on moving the jaw.
The swelling extends upward to the space between
the ear and cheek, and downward under the jaw, to
the submaxillary gland. It lasts from four to six
days, and subsides without suppuration; no external
application should be made to disperse the swelling,
for fear of a transfer to important vital organs as
above described, or which is most common, to the
breast of females or the testicles of males. In addition to the remedies which are detailed in the text,
1 would recommend Protiodide of Mercury, if the
swelling should be obstinate, or if it is transferred to
other glandular structures. -Ed.]
Mercury is the remedy that most frequently relieves this affection: more particularly when suppuration is about taking place.
If erysipelas attends the swelling, Belladonna
should be used: and after the pain has been removed, Hepar Sulphuris is very serviceable.
If mercurius and hepar sulphuris have been used
without success, Dulcamara is often of the greatest
service, this being particularly serviceable if the
urine is rendered turbid by the effect of the cold.
It is especially necessary to avoid dispelling or
dispersing these swellings by friction with liniments
