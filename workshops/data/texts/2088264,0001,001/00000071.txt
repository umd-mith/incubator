however, headache is associated with INDIGESTION,
it will be well to examine the symptoms connected
with the remedies for indigestion, before deciding on
the remedy to be used; more particularly if the headache is attended with indigestion.
It may be beneficial to remark, that headache, uncomplicated with indigestion, or as people commonly
but erroneously express their meaning, with biliousness, claims more attention and more skill, being attended with more danger, than headache, associated
with indigestion.
The majority of headaches are connected with
irritation of the stomach, technically gastric irritation, and of the intestines; an irritation, induced in
numberless instances by the destructive method of
attempting to cure diseases, more particularly those
miscalled bilious by purgatives. Such headaches,
admitting a ready alleviation by homceopathic medicines, have opened up a wide field, in which the
skilful homceopathic physician may wander with benefit to the sufferer, and with pleasure, with reward,
and with honor to himself.
