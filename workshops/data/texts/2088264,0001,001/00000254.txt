the injury may have been inflicted months, yea,
years,* before, so as almost to be forgotten, yet when
the symptoms existing can be traced so as to be decidedly consequent upon such injury, even then
arnica is exceedingly useful, and is often the first
step towards cure.
DERANGEMENT OF THE STOMACH.
This condition has often been the forerunner of
many severe diseased states, which, if the derange* A patient of mine, the Baron -, was attacked with a severe
illness, in the year 1842. He was evidently in great danger. Among
his symptoms was one of a feeling of a bruised condition of the
chest, affecting his breathing, producing severe pain on taking a
full breath, and attended with excessive prostration. I inquired
anxiously whether he had received any wound, having been a general during the continental wars, and engaged in many battles.
He said no: but on reflecting, remembered the following circumstance. As he was sitting on horseback watching the movements
of the army engaged in battle, with his aid-de-camp at his side, a
cannon-ball passed between his horse's head and his breast, and
taking the aid-de-camp in its course, made, to use the Baron's
own expression, a complete rag-fair of him, cleaving his body
asunder. The Baron experienced a shock, and his horse was so
affected that he shivered, so to speak, as to go upon his knees.
The excitement of the battle banished all the rest, and he had not
thought of the circumstance until I had thus brought the event
back to his memory.
I forthwith ordered Arnica internally and an Arnica poultice externally, and the change was so rapid as to convert to Homoeopathy
a most intelligent friend of the Baron's, who had been watching
the case with intense anxiety: the more so, because having no
faith in Homceopathy, he had the greatest fears on behalf of his
friend.
