ered over with two or three large soft napkins, on
which to lay and dry the child immediately on its being taken out of the water.
When dried, if the skin is ruffled, it should be
dusted with flour; but not if there is no ruffling.
After being dried, a flannel bandage, of five or six
inches in breadth, and of a length sufficient to go
round the body twice, is to be applied, but not to be
applied tight.
The child is then wrapped up in a flannel shawl
or blanket; or, if not exhibiting signs of fatigue, is
dressed. If exhibiting these signs, then the child is
allowed to sleep before being dressed.
The dress itself ought to be light, soft, warm, and
loose, and not long: the use of very long petticoats often
has induced deformity; moderate-lengthened clothes
keep the lower extremities warm. The clothes, as
Dr. Eberle suggests, should cover the neck, the
shoulders and the arms: for why should the legs be
kept warm, and the arms exposed to the cold? The
custom of exposing these parts, Dr. Eberle rightly
judges, is " one of the principal reasons why inflammatory affections of the respiratory organs are so
much more common during the period of childhood
than at a more advanced age." Of 379 fatal cases
of inflammation of the lungs, which occurred in the
British metropolis, 228 were children under three
years of age. (Registrar's Report, p. 74.)
Warm nightcaps are to be avoided; indeed all
caps, except when going into the air.
The child, as a general rule, should be washed
daily night and morning; immersing the body is the
-best mode.
