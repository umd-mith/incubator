In this disease,* other complications appear, requiring the physician; remembering        always, that
where febrile excitement or inflammatory action distresses, Aconite is to be used.
[I prefer writing an entire article on this disease,
rather than enlarge the author's, which is too brief to
be of any value, as a guide to discern the disease or
select the remedy.     The great diversity of shades
which scarlet fever presents, forbids the propriety of
attempting a description of them      all, which would
only confuse the lay practitioner.    Yet enough must
be said to enable him   to select understandingly the
suitable remedy, where a homceopathic physician is
not to be had.   The mildest form, or simple scarlet
rash, when properly treated, passes off in a few days,
without any untoward symptoms.          There is some

appearance of the skin.    A few doses of Belladonna
once in four hours, will be all the medical treatment
required.

* For the poison (if such language may be used,) of this disease
and of the preceding, the skill and the research of Hahnemann
discovered antidotes or preventives; so that these diseases, existing
in any family, can be stayed in their diffusion. To measles, the
preventives are aconite and pulsatilla, used alternately, a globule
every other day; to scarlet fever, belladonna,'a globule every day,
or every other day. Many evidences could be brought forward in
proof of the power of these medicines as prophylactics; one may
be related. I had, two years since, a little child who had the
scarlet fever; his sister three years older than himself, I caused
to sleep in the same bed, and to keep in the same room with himd
throughout his illness, she taking belladonna, a globule every other
day, and she did not have the disease.
