Sometimes a swelling, filled apparently with fluid,
appears at the fontanel, or the opening of the head,
as it is commonly called. If not disappearing from
the use of arnica, Rhus Toxicodendron should be administered.
Should the swelling still continue, notwithstanding
these means, Dr. Hering recommends to make a slight
incision, and let the fluid discharge.
Sometimes, from bad management, ulcers arise. In
such cases Silicea should be given.
Another affection troubling infants is
RUPTURE OR HERNIA.
Often the navel protrudes, called Umbilical Hernia. In such a case a bandage should be applied, a
piece of folded linen being placed upon the navel,
and the bandage going two or three times round the
body: the parent should see that the linen is kept in
its place, and when replacing the bandage, the rupture should be slightly pressed back by the hand.
This requires patience and care, which a mother will
be sure to bestow.
When the rupture is at the groin, called Inguinal
Hernia, no bandage need be applied.
The infant should take for either rupture, first
Nux Vomica: if this is not successful, then Veratrum: follow this by Chamomilla: and should these
not succeed, Sulphur must be used. The rupture
generally gets well.
