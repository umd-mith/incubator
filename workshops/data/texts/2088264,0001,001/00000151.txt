are bent upon the body: and by an inability to suck
during the attack.
When, in addition to these general symptoms, and
those mentioned under diarrhoea in connection with
chamomilla, the eyes are distorted, the saliva is accumulated in the mouth, and there is diarrhoea, with
green, watery, mixed with mucous, evacuations, then
Chamomilla is the remedy: in very mild dispositions,
Pulsatilla.
When, in addition to the general symptoms, the
following symptoms occur, Nux Vomica is indicated,
namely, hardened faeces, constipation: weight in the
lower part of the belly.
Pain, as if the intestines are squeezed in different
directions: pain, as in the belly upon pressure: and
coldness of the extremities at the time when the
affection is most violent.
Nux Vomica is the best remedy for windy colic,
which is attended by a feeling, when the wind is
about to escape of a sharp cutting instrument making
its way to the bladder, rectum, and the parts of the
lower part of the belly, attended with a desire but
want of power to make water: this being felt more
particularly in an erect posture, and being lessened
by lying down or sitting in a curved position.
When, however, the colic assumes the following
characters, then Colocynth is useful.
Violent pains in the belly, constant.
If not constant, returning with augmented intensity.
The pains having departed, a bruised feeling as
though the intestines were suspended by threads
easily broken, obliging the patient to walk slowly and
with extreme caution, remains behind.
