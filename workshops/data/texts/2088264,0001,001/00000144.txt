CONSTIPATION.*
Constipation is generally an effect of disease: not
of want of power in the intestines: not sluggishness,
but the effect of the vital power being occupied in
developing disease in some other part of the system.
When constipation occurs, both associated and unassociated with any chronic diseases, (very rarely indeed does the latter occur,) the following tabular view
(p. 140) will be of use in selecting the appropriate remedy; ever remembering, that without exercise, and
without proper food, there is no remedy for constipation. The bowels may be forced, but they will not
act; they may be emptied, but they will not empty
themselves.
When newly-born infants are troubled with constipation, the food they receive is generally the
cause. If a change of food does not relieve, then
employ Nux Vomica, if the child be active, noisy,
lively; Pulsatilla, if the child be mild and placid;
if there are acid risings, burning heat in the pharynx, gripings, livid complexion, debility, and shiverings.
These remarks apply to children as well as infants.
In women mild and placid, where constipation is
attended with chilliness, thirst absent, tendency to
shed tears, melancholia, Pulsatilla is useful.
Ignatia is suitable to gentle, amiable, lively persons; variable, sometimes lively, sometimes depressed.
