SWELLING OF THE CHEEK.
Often swelling of the cheek takes place from toothache, and the toothache ceasing, it disappears.
Often the medicine, say belladonna, which cures
the toothache, produces swelling of the cheek.
If this swelling should not disappear, the antidote
to belladonna, or whatever may have been the medicine employed for the toothache, must be used.
If the swelling is obstinate, and rather solid,
Arnica will be useful: if there is much salivation,
Mercury.
If these remedies are used too late, and suppuration must take place, a fig poultice is a very good one.
'When the suppuration is established, let it alone,
except to wash the mouth frequently with warm water.
In connection with the ears, the affection indicated
by
MUMPS, OR THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE PAROTID AND
SUBMAXILLARY GLANDS,
may be noticed.
The parotid and submaxillary glands are situated,
the one below the ear, the other under the jaw.
They separate the saliva from the blood.
