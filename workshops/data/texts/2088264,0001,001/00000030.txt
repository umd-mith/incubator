This enumeration of the medicines used, (and these are not
more than a third of those employed in homceopathic practice,)
will afford the best answer to the ignorance-founded assertion, that
hommeopathists use but ONE medicine. This is urged by some, it is
believed, because the medicines are colorless: a circumstance dependent upon the muedicines being prepared by trituration with
sugar of milk.
The examination of this Index will show, that the medicines to
be studied most are Aconite, Arnica, Arsenicum, Belladonna, Bryonia, Chamomilla, China, Ignatia, Nux Vomica, Opium, Pulsatilla, Rhus 'loxicodendron, and Sulphur.
