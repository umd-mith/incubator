vated when inspiring: great anxiety: cough, attended with much pain, dry at first, afterwards moist,
and the sputa tinged with blood. The pulse is full,
strong, and frequent, often palpitation of the heart:
the face is red and livid: thirst excessive: generally
constipation: urine high color, red: skin hot, dry
and burning.
A comparison of these symptoms with those detailed, in the Introduction, in connexion with aconite,
will demonstrate that Aconite should be at once administered, in successive doses, during the first twenty-four hours.
After the inflammatory and febrile symptoms have
given way partially, (often they will be entirely removed by the aconite,) Bryonia* can be given, especially if the sputa, tinged with blood, have a rusty
appearance: and where there are pains, considered
rheumatic, in the back.
Rhus and Squilla are useful under circumstances,
which will require the physician to decide.
Phosphorus, sulphur, and other medicines, are
useful in this disease, but the phenomena indicating
these need not be detailed, as the physician's aid is
sure to be sought.
[Phosphorus is the most important remedy for in* From the symptoms recorded in connexion with Aconite, it
will be seen that, where fever exists in connexion with inflammation it is peculiarly suitable. But Bryonia is suited also to inflammatory fevers. Aconite is suited where there is dry heat,
constant burning over the whole body. Bryonia is suited where
the internal heat is more developed than the external. Aconite is
suited where there is much thirst: Bryonia also where there is
violent thirst, and this for cold liquids. Aconite is suited where
the heat is constant. Bryonia is suited where there are alternations of chill and heat, or when both exist simultaneously, the latter internally, the other perceptible externally.
