From the symptoms detailed in the preceding columns, it will be seen that HEARTBURN, FLATULENCE,
NAUSEA, VOMITING, and CRAMP IN THE STOMACH,
are removable by most of the medicines: the choice
depends on the accompanying symptoms.
The following general remarks, in reference to
each of these diseased states, may be useful.
CARDIALGIA, OR HEARTBURN..When it occurs in children and sensitive persons,
and appears not complicated with other diseased affections, but is attended with a swollen painful condition of the region of the stomach and of the lower
belly, with frequent acid and disagreeable risings of
the food, with little or no flatulence; with palpitation of the heart, anxiety, tightness across the chest,
difficult breathing, and pains in the head, with a tendency to faint, then the treatment is easy.
Young children manifest this affection by bending
their legs on the body, by short breath, agitation, and
restlessness.
Chamomilla is the principal remedy; and if this
is not successful, medical aid must be sought.
[Sulphuric or Nitric Acid, first dilution, or higher,
if deemed best, is homceopathic to heartburn or
sour stomach, and has always been more successful
in my practice than any other class of remedies, in
producing a radical cure. In adults it may be preceded by Nux Vomica, if high living has been the
cause. Carbo Veget. if there is much flatulence, with
acid stomach. - Ed.]
