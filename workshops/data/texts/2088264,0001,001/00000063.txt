spread this as thick as the back.of a knife on strips
of linen, and cover the burns with it, being careful to
touch every spot: tie it well up, so as to keep the
soaped linen close to the skin: let it remain 18 to
26 hours, and remove with care, doing nothing but
apply fresh soaped linen. It will increase the burning at first, but the burning will soon be better.
When the burning recurs, apply fresh soaped linen.
This is a most speedy method, and if care be taken
in applying equally and completely the soaped linens,
no scar will be left.
Creosote water is useful where the application of
soap produces an offensive smell. The blisters being
cut and rinsed, and loose skin cut away, apply the
water to the wound with a hair pencil; put on
linen rags dipped in it, and a tight bandage to exclude
the air.  Renew the water each time the wound
pains, or about twice a-day.
When febrile action is induced, Aconite must be
employed: when diarrhoea supervenes it is curative,
and ought not to be arrested unless excessive: in all
cases of burns, water should be taken plentifully and
exercise in the air.
Another affection, requiring immediate treatment is
THE WOUND.
The parts should be washed with warm water to
remove any dirt or foreign substance: the edges of
the wound, whether cut or torn, should be brought
as nearly as possible together, and then strap with
arnica plaster, so as to keep them in contact.
