Whiere the skin is destroyed, and the parts below
injured, the physician's aid must be sought.
Where the affection is slight, the old practice of
holding the part burned or scalded to the fire is quite
hommeopathic; the common practice of applying cold
water,'or cold potatoes sliced, cold carrots, or anything cooling, is injurious.  Goulard's lotion has
often caused death by the lead, contained therein,
poisoning the individual.
Where the affection is more extensive, the use of
heated*l spirits of wine, brandy, hot rum, or oil of
turpentine, applied by soaking and keeping constantly
moist old soft clean rags or lint, is also homoeopathic.
Cotton is very excellent: it should be applied immediately, pulled fine, and if cotton wadding is used, be
slit open and applied in thin layers, previously cutting open all blisters and rinsing them with warm
water.
[Cotton batting with Olive Oil is the best and most
effectual applications to recent burns, indeed nothing
else is required, if this is applied at once and kept on,
without meddling with it in any other way than to
moisten the cotton with the oil. It is too simple for
many meddling practitioners, but it is the best application, and   the  most uniformly successful and
soothing of any that I ever tried. - Ed.]
The best remedy in most cases, is soap: take white
or Castile soap, (not brown soap,) shave it fine, and
convert it by lukewarm water into a thick salve:
* Spirits of wine, &amp;c., may be heated by putting some in a dish
on or near the stove; but for immediate use, the best plan is to set
fire to the spirit, and let it burn till it is heated, then extinguish
the flame by covering it, and use this till the other is heated.
