Belladonna: The many remarks already made in
connection with it, show it to be indicated wherever
there is cerebral irritation.
It was noticed that diarrhcea often attends the process of teething: sometimes the opposite state attends,
namely, constipation: then Nux Vomica will be serviceable.
Further particulars in reference to teething, when
spasms attack the child, will be seen under the head
of
CONVULSIONS.
The flesh of the human body is technically called
muscle: pach muscle is composed of numerous little
muscular fibres or threads; each fibre or thread being endowed with the power of contraction, and afterwards of relazation. When the muscles dependent on the will, hence called voluntary, in their contraction and relaxation follow the will of the individual, they act naturally; but when the muscles
contract without the will of the individual, such
contraction, being irregular is called spasm: and
when such contractions occur in rapid succession,
the term CONVULSIONS is applied thereto.
The contraction and relaxation of the muscular
threads depend upon the nervous power conveyed to
them by the nerves, connected with the brain or with
the spinal cord: and therefore whenever any convulsions occur, these can be traced in most cases to some
irritation of the brain or of the spinal cord.
