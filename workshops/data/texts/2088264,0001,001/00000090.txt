icate membrane or skin, through which the impressions are made upon the nerve of smell.
This membrane, called the Schneiderian, from its
discoverer, covers a large surface, the interior of the
nose being divided into cavities, formed by very thin
bony partitions. These cavities are called nasal
fossce.
Through this membrane an immense number of
blood-vessels are distributed. From these blood-vessels, in young people of full habit, particularly females before the natural change, and, in adult females, at the cessation of the natural discharge, a
discharge takes place, called
BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE, OR EPISTAXIS.
Bleeding from the nose is sometimes beneficial, it
appearing as the crisis of many diseases. When it
occurs frequently, and when the quantity of blood
discharged is considerable, then medicine is required.
In curing bleeding from the nose, two objects present themselves: first, to remove the bleeding; and
second, to prevent a recurrence, and relieve the
other consequences likely to result from the bleeding.
Several remedies can be employed. The choice
can be regulated by the symptoms.
Aconite is useful where the symptoms recorded,
(see Introduction,) are present; or if the person
looks much heated, or if-the bleeding occurs after
being overheated.
Bryonia is useful under similar circumstances as
belladonna, p. 85, more particularly when the bleeding from the nose takes place from sudden suppression of the menses.
