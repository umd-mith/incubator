rinse his mouth occasionally, with vinegar. As soon
as the sufferer begins to breathe, or the exhalation of
the breath infused becomes more rapid, cease the
infusion, blow gently fresh air towards him, and only
when the breath becomes stronger, hold a sponge to
his mouth dipped in a very weak solution of chloride
of lime or vinegar. You ought to be very careful,
indeed, lest you extinguish the feeble life just returning. If the patient recovers, give him a few drops of
a weak solution of chloride of lime or vinegar. If he
complains of cold, inclination to go to stool, or nausea, and vinegar will not remove this feeling, or the
patient dislikes it, give him a little black coffee; if
he complains of heat and great weakness, give him
a little good, and, if possible, old wine. The smell
of camphor is also often beneficial. Consult in this
respect the wishes of the patient; whatever is most
agreeable to him, or affords him relief, deserves the
preference.
Another mephitic gas is developed in deep wells,
vaults, and lime furnaces, which is suffocating. It

Persons affected by it will usually revive in a short
time, if they are speedily brought into the fresh air,
sprinkled with cold water, and with vinegar, and particularly by the infusion of black coffee. Do not act
with too much precipitation - delay is not dangerous
in such a case. If respiration does not return, it will
be necessary to blow in some breath.,
The vapor of charcoal is very dangerous, particularly to persons sleeping. Never sleep with lighted
charcoal in a chamber without a chimney. This
