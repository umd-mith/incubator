tion of parts, is induced by injuries in many persons:
and when this is the case, Arnica is more specific
than belladonna. The homceopathicity of arnica in

and some other remedy would have been more appropriate.
CONVULSIONS, especially in infants, result oftentimes from an injury. In these cases, arnica will be

circumstances, I may add, that the successful result
of several cases has led me to believe, that, though
