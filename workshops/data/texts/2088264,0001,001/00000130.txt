[TIC DOULOUREUX.
The nerves of the face in this disease are very sensitive, and the pain, is more excruciating than any
other to which we are liable. The paroxysms are
sudden and often repeated, with intervals of perfect
ease. The patient often feels as if a red hot needle
was piercing through the part, which distinguishes
it from toothache. There is no swelling.
T r e a t m e n t.-Aconite sometimes is necessary at
first, if there should be heat.
Belladonna, if the pain is excited by touching the
part, twitches in the eye-lids, convulsive jerks of the
muscles of the face, with occasional flush.
Causticum, if the jaws should be stiff and noise
in the ears.
Mezereum, when the pains extend into the eye,
temple, ear, neck, and teeth, when coming into the air.
Lycopodium, when the right side of the face is
principally the seat of pain, and there is a sensation
of coldness, and the symptoms are worse at night.
M1Iercurius, if the entire one side of the head from
the temples to the teeth are affected, more particularly at night after getting warm in bed, particularly
if there is a predisposition to a flow of tears and saliva.
Conium, if the pains come on at night, and are
of a shooting character.
Colocynth, if the pains are of a shooting character, and occupy the left side of the face, and are
aggravated by the touch.
