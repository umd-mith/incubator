taken to be a principal one, which it is not. This
refers also to grease, butter, and similar things:also to buttered water. If to be used, you ought to
be careful of the kind of oil; -rancid oil, train-oil,
or sperm oil, ought not to be applied, slimy substances will answer far better to envelop the poison,
or sugar, which sooner assuages the stomach, or
other means to neutralize the poison. When you are
sure that the poison was alkaline, and you are applying vinegar successfully, you may alternate with oil,
particularly when the patient complains of burning
in his mouth, throat, or stomach. Oil, however,
may be applied to great advantage, when a strong
acid, aqua fortis, oil of vitriol, &amp;c. has got into the
eye, the mouth, the throat, or the stomach. Sometimes
it is also serviceable against poisonous mushrooms.
Oil is hurtful in poisoning by arsenic; useless in most
poisonings from metallic substances; and very injurious when Spanish flies get into the eye, or stomach.
It is literally throwing oil into the fire. This is also the
case with insects and venomous bugs, which may have
got into the eye. Oil is of great service when live insects have crept into the ear.
Milk is not so good as other viscid substances;
but as it is more frequently at hand, it will be well
to let the sufferer drink of it, instead of waiting for
other things. Fat milk is good wherever oil is good,
injurious wherever that is injurious. Sour milk is
good wherever vinegar is so, injurious wherever that
is. When you have no good oil, fat milk is the best
thing; also when oil becomes disgusting to the patient. Sour milk is preferable to bad vinegar; it may
also be applied where vinegar has already been used.
