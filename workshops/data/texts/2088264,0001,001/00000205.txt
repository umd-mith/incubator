SECTION 2.
DIRECTIONS AFTER DELIVERY.
To all homceopathists, ARNICA is known as a specific against bruises of soft parts. The process of
forcing the child through the passage from  the
womb to the air may be regarded as a process, in
which the soft parts are bruised; although here it is
worthy of remark, the Creator has so appropriately
constructed the parts, that form the walls of the genital apparatus in women, that these parts are capable
of dilatability, so that they expand during delivery,
and thereby give room by diminishing their mass
by diffusing that mass over a wide surface.
But still the process is a slightly bruising process.
This idea led me to use arnica; and the benefits resulting from its use are so great, that I know no
remedy so serviceable, and no use of a remedy more
delightful than this of arnica. I could give many
cases illustrative.
The arnica can be used both internally and externally: internally, two globules in a wine-glass of
water: externally, by means of a lotion, formed of
forty drops of the tincture to a small tumbler of
water.
