Many persons think it necessary to give the infant
immediately after birth, laxatives, to expel the meconium. The milk of the mother is the best agent
to effect this. The child is put to the breast about
six to eight hours after its birth: the milk then is
very dilute, and produces the desired effect. If not,
a little sugar and water will produce the effect: if
not, a lavement of a quarter of a pint of warm
water can be used.
Should these means not succeed, then the means
for constipation can be used by the mother.
As absurd as giving the child physic directly it is
born, is that of giving the child food. It has just
come from a rich depository of nutriment: it needs
to wait a few hours, not exceeding twelve.
In regard to the diet of the infant, the fact that
the milk comes when the child is born, points out
that the mother's milk -is the proper nutriment of the
child, unless constitutional taint affects the parent.
If the child is suckled by a nurse, a nurse whose
child is of the same age as that of the one to be fostered, is to be selected: and this for-the reason that
the milk varies in strength according to the period
after birth: becoming more concentrated each month,
so that the milk of a woman, whose child is six
months old, is not suited to a child who is only a
month old.
If the mother cannot supply the proper amount of
nourishment, then cow's milk can be used, diluting
it to a degree in which its strength will be on a par
with that of the mother's milk; and as the mother's
milk is warm, it should be made lukewarm.
