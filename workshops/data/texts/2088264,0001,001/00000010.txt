Part, on DIET. To this succeeds another Part, in
which some of the terms used in this work are explained, to which, if the reader has any difficulty he
should refer.
It may be proper here to remark that I have still
adhered to the classification of the diseases adopted
in the first edition; a classification, founded upon
the different organs affected: such being more particularly useful in enabling the reader to find out,
both the remedies best suited to the diseases, and the
diseases themselves; an arrangement, which with
pleasure I have seen adopted in a late work on
Homceopathic Domestic Medicine.
It will be seen, that, among the diseases, the
remedies for which are recorded, are many, technically called acute: diseases, which require the attendance of the physician; still, the means of cure
are detailed, because till the arrival of or the communication with, the physician, danger may thus be
warded off, or the progress of the disease may be
stayed. This detail of acute diseases and their remedies has been of the greatest service: I have patients in Manchester and other places, who have successfully treated croup by the means detailed. Croup,
it is well known, is an acute and highly dangerous
disease, and one, which under the injurious treatment, designated, par excellence, "ACTIVE," is often
fatal; and the successful treatment of this disease,
even under domestic direction, (I do not recommend
persons to trust to such direction wholly,) shows the
utter fallacy of the ignorant but pompously promulgated notion, that Homceopathic remedies are efficacious only in chronic and not in acute diseases.
