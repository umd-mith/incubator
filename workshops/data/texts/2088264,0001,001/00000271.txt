Soap water is the principal antidote in poisoning
by arsenic, lead, oil of vitriol, aqua fortis, all strong
acids, and most metallic solutions. You may conclude that the poisoning originated from acids, when
the mouth of the patient is as if burnt, when blue
paper dipt in what he vomited turns red on the instant. Soap water is also applicable when a person
has swallowed alum. It will also prove beneficial in
poisonings by plants of a burning, acrid taste, exuding a pungent juice or milk; likewise in dangerous
accidents from castor oil.
Vinegar is an antidote against alkaline poison.
As soon as this is ascertained let the patient drink
vinegar in great abundance, and give him injections
of it. Let him also eat slimy gruel which will excite,
vomiting. Yet vinegar will be injurious upon strong
vegetable poisons, various salts, all mineral acids,
arsenic, particularly when:the stomach pains when
touched. On the other hand it is of great service in
cases of poisoning from laudanum, mushrooms, all
soporifics, carbonic gas, and liver of sulphur. In
such cases alternate with gruel to bring on vomiting,
and subsequently, after having vomited freely, let the
patient drink vinegar again, which will remove a
continued inclination to vomit. Vinegar will also
answer against poisonous clams and fish. It is an
important antidote against the poison developed from
fat. If a person feel sick from having eaten spoiled
rancid hams or sausages, and his throat is very dry,
and he feels nausea, you will hasten to give him vinegar to drink, not forgetting however, the other remedies afore-mentioned.
Oil is a remedy by far too generally applied, and
