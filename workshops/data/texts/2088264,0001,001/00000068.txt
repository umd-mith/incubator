sometimes a comatose state: delirium: desire to
bury the head in the bolster: eyes suffused and brilliant, pupils often contracted: inclination to thrust
the fingers into the nostrils: grinding the teeth:
many indications of spasm: great heat, proportionate
thirst: visible throbbings in the neck: forcing down
of the lower part of the abdomen: constipation:
sometimes slight diarrhcea.
When such symptoms present themselves, it is certain that the physician's advice will be sought: it
may, however, be useful to enumerate the symptoms,
indicating other stages in the disease.
When the disease is more fully advanced, the patient manifests strong fits of passion: as intolerance
of light: often wrinkles his brows: has pains in his
ears: has nausea, attended often with vomiting, and
cannot sleep: or, if sleeping, has frights.
The first step to be taken is to give Aconite, which
will subdue the symptoms connected with the congestion in the head.
This should be followed by the use of Belladonna,
when the symptoms just described are prominent.
When, however, the patient lies in bed, without
taking notice, with the eyes closed: sinks down
without cognizance: raves upon his own private affairs: the mouth opening with difficulty: the tongue
loaded with white and frothy mucus: dilatation of
the pupil and fixedness of the eye: redness of face:
smiles: stutters inarticulately: is, at times, perfectly
quiescent: has frequent twitchings: moves his hands
as if to withdraw the coverlid, attended with anxious
and weak respiration, full pulse, tense abdomen, and
skin dry and disposed to crack, then Ilyoscyamus is
the best remedy.
