globules in a teacupfull of water and use for an injection. In the meantime, several drops of very cold
water, or a very small stream of it, may pass from a
tea-kettle, and fall from the height of five or six feet
on the breast of the infant, but particularly on the
left side of the breast: one person stands on a chair
or table with the kettle, another raises the infant with
its breast out of the water, and immediately after puts
it again into the warm water, repeating this several
times; afterwards the gentle rubbing and pressing of
the limbs, with warm hands, must be renewed, and
thus alternated for some time. Old persons are not
as fit for this service as are the young, vigorous, and
healthy. As soon as symptoms of urination appear,

hours, then cease to rub and to pour water; let the
infant remain in warm water until it begins to breathe
and cry, then wrap it in a good cloth and lay it by
