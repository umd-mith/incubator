fear, unless actually producing unpleasant symptoms,
and unless they are sharp-pointed, such as pins,
hooks, &amp;c., and then medical aid will be sought.
Calmness is here the condition the most necessary:
more mischief results from a rash interference than
from the undisturbed presence of the foreign body
in the throat for a short time.
A few months since, a striking instance of the inefficacy of being in a hurry to do something, was pre-sented in the treatment of the celebrated Mr. Brunel,
who had allowed some body to get into his windpipe.
Two incisions were made into his windpipe, but
without effect; but being let alone for a time, and
*then by using a slight but wisely-managed movement,
the body, that had gained admission into the windpipe, was discharged. His life was much more
periled by the cutting into his windpipe, than by the
presence of the foreign body there.
To show how useful presence of mind and tact
are, the following circumstance, related by Dr. Hering, is worthy of insertion: " A child once swallowed a fish-hook, so that the string stuck out of the
mouth; to push it down was dangerous and hazardous; to pull it up, impossible; if remaining within,
it might prove mortal. The physician had the rare
presence of mind to hit upon the only proper means;
he had a leaden ball perforated, drew the string
through the hole, and pushed the ball down the
throat; the fish-hook was loosened from the flesh,
and, lying fast to the ball was pulled up again."
