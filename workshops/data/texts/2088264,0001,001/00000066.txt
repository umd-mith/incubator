duced, when, after a fall or any other violence, a limb
pains severely, so that it cannot be moved without
pain, swells, and turns red, called
*?           A SPRAIN,
may be noticed.
The parts, which bind the bony joints together, are
called ligaments.  They are extremely strong; but
when a joint is subjected to any violent shock, or
extension, the ligaments become morbidly affected,
and pain, weakness, and swelling, occur in them and
the adjacent parts.
In these cases, Arnica is to be used, both internally in solution, and externally by friction.
Should not the arnica remove the pain, the swelling, and redness, Rhus Tozicodendron must be employed. Sometimes Bryonia is needed.
Another very common affection is
A BRUISE.
Any injury by a rounded or blunted substance to
a soft part of the body, is attended with swelling,
and often an extravasation of blood, giving a mottled
appearance to the part.
Here again, Arnica, externally and internally used,
is the best remedy.
Instead of using friction, as in a strain, an application by rags soaked in solution of arnica, should
be employed.
