let the patient smell it, or rub it on his skin. You
can make a salve of it with warm oil, or easily dissolve it in heated brandy.
It is the principal antidote in all accidents from
insects. Against Spanish flies, whether they have
been swallowed, or got into the eye, or when used
as a plaster, they have a poisonous effect, camphor is
always the best remedy. Also, when venomous insects or infected honey have been swallowed, in violent symptoms after meals, in which small bugs or
worms may have accidentally fallen, or when one has
swallowed small moths; likewise after the sting of
insects.
When, together with other symptoms, the patient
finds it difficult to urinate, or this is very painful to
him, and intermixed with blood, you may always presume that this originates from Spanish flies, or other
insects, and camphor is the best remedy.
Camphor is finally applicable, when accidents result from the medicine a sick person has taken;
when children sicken after the usual preposterous
worm medicines; in accidents from tobacco, bitter
almonds and medicines that liave the smell of these
things, or cherry-stones, peach-kernels, acorns, or
nuts.
It will mitigate after-pains from phosphorus, poisoning by minerals or acids, and particularly salty
things.  When, through vomiting, everything has
been ejected from the stomach, let the patient smell
camphor from time to time. This may also be done
in poisonings by mushrooms, or in accidents from
charcoal fire.
