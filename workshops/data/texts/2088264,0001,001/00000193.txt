pains, from which many women in confinement suffer
so much, depend upon the inability of the womb,
unaided by the abdominal muscles, (these having
been weakened by the want of healthy action, from
the impediments of tight lacing,) to expel the child.
Stays, tight stays or tight abdominal supporters,
produce worse effects than this. They often occasion the child to occupy a position in the womb, not
according to its natural position, and thereby, if not
occasioning deformity, which often is the case, causes
trouble and oftentimes danger in the birth.  Dr.
Eberle remarks, " the custom of wearing tightlylaced corsets during gestation, cannot beptoo severely

mother and child, must often result from a continual
and forcible compression of the abdomen, whilst
nature is at work in gradually enlarging it, for the
accommodation hnd the development of the foetus.
By this unnatural practice, the circulation of the
blood throughout the abdomen is impeded, - a circumstance which, together with the mechanical compression of the abdominal organs, is peculiarly calculated to give rise to functional disorder of the stomach
and liver, as well as to hemorrhoids, uterine hemorrhage, and abortion. The regular nourishment of
the foetus, also, is generally impeded in this way - a
fact, which is frequently verified in the remarkable
delicate and emaciated condition of infants, born of
mothers who have practised this fashionable folly

general among females,certain forms of uterine disease
