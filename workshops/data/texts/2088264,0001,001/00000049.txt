never to seek to get rid of cutaneous affections merely
by external remedies.
Besides these more particularly local affections of
the skin, this membrane is affected by several eruptive maladies, attended with fever, and with an affection of the general constitution.
Of these, the first is
THE CHICKEN-POX, (VARICELLA.)
This occurs in children, resident in neighborhoods
wherein small-pox abounds. Hence pretenders to
medical science call it small-pox, and thus they, impudent from ignorance, bring disrepute upon vaccination.
The little elevations, containing matter or pus,
hence called pustules, in chicken-pox are more
pointed and irregular in their appearance than are
those of small-pox: the disease, too, is milder in its
progress, and shorter in its duration, terminating
generally in a week. It is attended generally with
cold in the head, and slight fever.
Aconite at the commencement will subdue the fever: and Cofeca will remove any agitation, exhibited
in restlessness and anxiety.
Should spasm supervene, especially if the child be
teething, Chamomilla is to be preferred.
If the child raises the head with difficulty, and the
head and the hands are hot, much headache, and
there is agitation with griping pains, Belladonna is
indicated.
