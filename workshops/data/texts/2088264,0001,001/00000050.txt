When suppuration is taking place, Mercurius aids
the cure.
Another eruptive pustular disease is
THE SMALL-POX, (VARIOLA.)
This disease still exists, its continued existence
being a fruit of the ignorance and the prejudice of
mankind.
It presents itself in four stages: the febrile, the
eruptive, the pustule-maturative, and the desiccating
stage.
Each stage is attended with its peculiar symptoms
and its peculiar dangers.
In the febrile stage numerous spots appear; this
stage being attended with lassitude, headache, oftentimes bleeding at the nose, vomiting, tenderness on
pressure at the pit of the stomach, and excessive pain
in the loins.
In this stage, Aconite moderates the fever and the
congestion of the internal organs.
When the nervous system is excessively irritable,
the eyes particularly sensitive of light, the glands of
the neck much swollen, then Belladonna; if the
sleepiness is overpowering, then Opium.
In the eruptive stage, the red spots become elevated and filled with a semitransparent fluid; and
on the third to the fourth day, the pustules are completely formed on the face, and the patient complains
of itching.
