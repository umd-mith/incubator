Another disease of the intestines, approaching in
some features to diarrhcea, is
CHOLERA.
This disease occurs most frequently in the summer: is referred, generally, to the fruits eatenr, but
is more justly referrible to the heat of the atmosphere deranging the liver, and thereby modifying the
secretion of the bile.
Before an attack of cholera, many symptoms,
called bilious, generally appear: inactivity: heaviness: jaundiced complexion: tongue covered with a
yellow mucus: bitter taste: dislike to food: bitter
risings: fulness at the pit of the stomach, with pressure and cramps: urine deposits a reddish sediment,
and smells offensively, and is passed with pain.
Chamomilla will remove these symptoms.
If these symptoms are neglected, the patient vomits
first his food, and then a watery bilious fluid; violent diarrhoea takes place, the secretions being at first
fetid, afterwards watery and bilious. These symptoms neglected, or improperly treated, the pulse
sinks: spasms in different parts of the body appear:
tenesmus, cold perspirations, and even syncope.
Ipecacuanha is to be used when the vomitings and
the diarrhcea are established.
If cold sweats appear, and the vomitings and the
purgings do not abate under the use of ipecacuanha,
Veratrum must be employed.,
If there is insatiable thirst: pulse scarcely perceptible: excessive prostration of strength: almost
constant purging, the matter tinged with blood, then
Arsenic must be employed.
