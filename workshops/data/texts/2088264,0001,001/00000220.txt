die, without curtains. The child, in the earlier periods of its existence, has little more than a vegetative existence. It lives to eat, to grow, and to sleep,
and ought to sleep much.
The best time for sleepingris the morning; afternoon sleep may interfere withEthe night sleep.
Nature will bring sleep. Any nurse that gives any
syrup, cordial, or carminative, ought to be dismissed.
All these advertisement-praised remedies are poisons,
ILL-USED.
Children, that have these poisons administered,
never attain that age they might have attained, or
become so vigorous as they otherwise would.
Parents should remember, then, that sleeplessness
now will be sleep hereafter, whereasforced sleep now
will bring, from diseases thus induced, weeks of sleeplessness hereafter.*
VACCINATION.
Before the child is weaned it should, if possible,
always be vaccinated.
The vaccination can be performed with success at
any time and at any season.
The vaccine fluid should be taken from children
free from all eruptions, and it should be clear; which
it is always when pure, and when not mixed with the
blood, which latter need not be drawn if the vaccine
vesicle is opened in a proper way.

its Principles Explained." By John Epps, M. D.
