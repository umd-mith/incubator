The slips should be a few inches long, and should
be narrower in the middle than at the ends; warm
them either by breathing on the medicinated side, or
by wrapping them on the unmedicinated side to a
bottle of hot water or round the arm, till the plaster
becomres soft; pull tightly, so that the edges of the
wound throughout may be kept closely together.
Between the strips, leave at the most depending point
an open spot to let the humor out, in case the wound
should form matter or suppurate.
When the edges are brought together the bleeding
almost invariably stops: if it should not be arrested,
apply compresses, and when fixed steadily and firm,
let them be steeped in a dilution of Arnica; a teaspoonful of the tincture to six table spoonsful of
water.
Should the bleeding be from any large vessel, and
especially if it be red blood and issues by jerks, the
bleeding is dangerous. In such a case, tie a cloth
or silk handkerchief above the wound. If the blood
still escapes by jerks, then feel on the inner side of
the limb till the beating of an artery is perceived;
put on this a cork, press it; put over it some doubled
linen folded to the thickness of a finger, and surround
the whole with a bandage, tightening it till the blood
stops. At first the bleeding may augment, but it will
soon cease.

not cease, haste for medical assistance.  Let the
patient take some salt on his tongue; if this does not
benefit, then a little vinegar and water. Let him lie
high with the wounded part, and see that his garments
are perfectly loose, and that no part of his body is
