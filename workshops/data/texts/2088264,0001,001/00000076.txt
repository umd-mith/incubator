CHAPTER III.
AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES AND THE
EYELIDS.
1. Inflammation.
la. Inflammation of the Eyes of New-Born Children.
lb. Inflammation of the Eye from some body acting
on the Eye.
2. Catarrhal Ophthalmia.
3. Stye.
THE eyes are organs, which, by their use, delicacy,
and importance, well deserve the place they hold.
They are subject to disease, more particularly,
INFLAMMATION.
Children, just born, have often inflammation from
sudden exposure to too strong a light. Sensibility of
the eye to light is the first symptom: a slight redness
appears in the portion of the conjunctiva covering
the eyelid, especially at the internal angle of the eye,
and a viscid secretion is formed on the eyelids.
Aconite, with cleanliness, will remove this; when
the intolerance of light is excessive, and when the
white of the eyes is much reddened, Belladonna may
be administered after the aconite.
The remnants of the disease are removed by
Sulphur: or if not, Calcarca Carbonica will, in
general, cure.
