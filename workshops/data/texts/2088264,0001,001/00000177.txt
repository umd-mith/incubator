The eyes should be opened; if the pupils are very
small, or one very small, the other very large, bleeding must not be practised. But if the pupils are
large, or the one very large and the other as usual,
bleeding may be resorted to, if a skilful homceopathist, able to select a remedy suitable to the case is
not present.
If the pulse be full and slow, the face red or pale,
give opium to smell, and lay a few globules on the
tongue; and if relief is not obtained, inject a pint of
water, in which some globules have been dissolved:
if the pulse is very weak, give Lachesis likewise.
Tartar Emetic is useful, when a nausea or inclination to vomit has preceded the attack, or a choking
has appeared, then, when the patient is waking, give
some teaspoonsfull of a weak solution of tartar emetic,
one grain dissolved in half a glass of water; if requisite give an injection of the same.
* For the remarks on this Section and the succeeding Sections of
this Chapter, I am indebted to Dr. Hering; and to the statements
in reference to the recovery of drowned, strangled, and frozen persons, the attention of the benevolent is particularly directed.
