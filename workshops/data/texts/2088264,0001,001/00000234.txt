When the stomach has been overloaded, and flatulence and constipation attend the sleeplessness, then
Pulsatilla can be used.
If the infant cries constantly, and contracts the
legs upon the belly, tosses about incessantly, and has
severe griping pains, with purging, China will be
found useful.
When some children are weaned they are very
sleepless; the deprivation will in part explain the
watchfulness; but if the watchfulness continues,
Belladonna will afford relief.
A second affection is
THE CRYING OF INFANTS.
Some infants are incessantly screaming,* and apparently without cause; though this is more the case
in children under a year old.
A dose of Belladonna will often cause this to
cease.
If much agitation and restlessness are present,
Chamomilla.
If there is a frequent disposition to relieve the
bowels, the discharge sour, and the actions present
* It should ever be remembered, that any means but proper
means to induce a cessation of crying, only perils the child's future
health and happiness: all allow the troublesomeness of crying
children; but if the trouble is spared now by unwise means, it
will be increased tenfold at a future day.
