Should the attack become more severe after the
exhibition of any remedy, a delay should take place.
Should no alteration be produced, repeat the remedy
as soon as a worse attack shows itself.
Should the attacks alter and lessen in severity, wait
for some time, to see whether the improvement continues, or if any change takes place: then select the
remedy most appropriate.
Weak sickly children, who have convulsions without any other symptoms, are treated best by Coffama.
The absurdity in convulsions of what is called
active treatment, i. e., bleeding, blistering, leeching,
&amp;c. is shown by the phenomena of epileptic attacks
in adults, which, though presenting convulsions most
violent, the patient always recovers best if left alone.
[SCROFULA. (KING'S EVIL.)
This disease is generally confined to certain families, and is called hereditary, because it passes from
one generation to another. It as often attacks the
palace as the hovel. Whatever tends to debilitate,
cold, damp air, want of exercise, proper food, warm
clothing, or attention to cleanliness, predisposes the
constitution to this disease. It shows itself in too
great a variety of shapes and locations to be fully
treated of here. The more general places of attack
are the glandular structures, comprising, first, the
glands of the neck, which slowly suppurate and finally
discharge a flabby matter something like curd; this
continues to form, and the opening shows very little
disposition to heal.
