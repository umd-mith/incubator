If, notwithstanding these means, the nipples should
become sore, give sulphur for two days, and wash the
nipples with cold water, having five or six globules
of the sulphur dissolved therein. If after two or

The milk coagulates in the milk vessels, swelling
takes place: the skin becomes tense, and inflammation, approaching to erysipelas, takes place; this, if

Belladonna, if administered when the erysipelatous appearance, and the swelling first appear, will
