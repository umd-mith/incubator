FAINTING.
The first advice is, be not in a hurry. This produces confusion, and often injury. Let all tight garments be-loosened; let the patient lie horizontally;
let the crowd be dismissed; and let one or two persons, and those, if possible, known to the patient, be
in the room. Many persons have been seriously injured by discovering themselves, on recovery, unexpectedly, in the presence of numerous strangers.
Having loosened the garments, sprinkle with a
feather a little clear water lightly on the face, sprinkle some on the nape of the neck and the back of
the head, and, if not successful, then on the pit of
the stomach.
