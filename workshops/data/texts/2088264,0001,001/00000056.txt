days from the time of the exposure to the contagion
of scarlet fever, the patient will become restless and
feverish, and if very severe, sickness and vomiting
will show itself. Very soon, generally within twenty-four hours, the rash will appear; first upon the
storach and bowels; then upon the neck, face, and
finally upon the extremities and entire surface.
The color is a bright red, resembling the shell of
a boiled lobster; not perfectly uniform over the body,
but slightly variegated, and there are no elevations
like the measles or small-pox, except a very fine grater-like, pimply surface, which, on close inspection,
is found to contain lymph. The redness disappears
on pressure being applied, and returns very quickly
when it is removed. The eyes are much less affected
than in measles, and there is very little or no cough
in this disease; whereas in measles it is a very prominent symptom. In the more malignant scarlet fever,
the throat is inflamed and swollen from the commencement, and has a rapid tendency to mortification.
There is great accumulation of mucus in the throat,
which produces great difficulty of swallowing and
breathing. The patient is extremely restless and
sleepless; slight delirium attends: nausea or even
vomiting is common, and is indicative of cerebral
(brain) disturbance, and when it ushers in the disease it is the precursor of a violent attack.
The tongue is often coated, of a deep ash color
through the centre, with the edges bright red, with
red projecting points called papille. The coating
clears off early, leaving the whole surface in this condition, becoming dry and hard during sleep.
