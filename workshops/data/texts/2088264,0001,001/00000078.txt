There is an inflammation of the eye and the eyelids, connected with cold, called
CATARRHAL OPHTHALMIA.
The eyes and eyelids are red: there is a sense
of burning and pressure as from a grain of sand:
light is dreaded: tears flow, and often an abundant
mucous discharge: to these symptoms are added
catarrh, with or without fever, and a dry troublesome
cough.
Aconite will subdue the inflammation, and Nux
Vomica the other symptoms.
When the inflammation is intense, the redness is
intense, also the other symptoms; when there is a
severe cold in the head, producing excoriation of the
nostrils, the wings of the nose and the lips, attended
with small pustules, and cough at intervals, with a
suffocation and wheezing, Belladonna should be used
after the aconite; copious discharge is the characteristic of this ophthalmia.
When the redness extends over the whole of the
eyes, the secretion of tears is abundant, and there is
itching by day and adhering by night, margins of eyelids ulcerated, moist and purulent, with frequent
blinking of the eyes, shunning light, then Euphrasia
is best.
When with the symptoms detailed in the first
paragraph, there are itching, chiefly in the open air,
and a swollen state of the eyelids, then Mercurius can
be employed.
Some diseases affect only the eyelids. The choice
of remedies will be aided by the following tabular
statement:
