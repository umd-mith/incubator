A  second affection of the stomach and of the
bowels, very common, is
FLATULENCE.
Flatulence is dependent in numerous cases upon
general causes; such as food of bad quality or excessive quantity; unsuitable drinks; and then immediate relief can be afforded.
When, from the wind, the lower intestines are
affected with pains and a sense of tightness, the tightness being felt also under the false ribs, the wind not
effecting its escape, China is very serviceable.
When constipation exists, as will be seen from the
table, and the sufferer is of a lively temperament,
Nux Vomica is useful.
When flatulence follows the use of rich food, and
when it occurs in women of a mild and gentle
disposition, Pulsatilla is an appropriate remedy.
A more active remedy is Cocculus: it is useful
when, in addition to the sense of tightness and contraction in the lower belly, similar feelings exist in
the genital organs: also when there is a swelling at
the pit of the stomach; uneasiness at the stomach:
gripings, twitchings, anxiety, and pressure under the
cartilages of the ribs, not diminished by the discharge
of wind, but relieved by the expulsion of the offending matters.

A third affection, in which the stomach is intimately concerned, is Vomiting.
