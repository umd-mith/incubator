The most characteristic symptom of the influenza,
in addition to the usual symptoms of catarrhal fever,
is extreme prostration of all the powers, mental and
bodily: the person is unmanned.
ARSENICUM is the remedy, when with this prostration there are the symptoms, described as pertaining
to arsenicum, (pp. 87, 88,) under the title of COLD
IN HEAD, and, those under the title of COUGH, (pp.
96-100.)
The influenza that prevails now (February, 1844,)
and has prevailed this last month, is attended with
afections of the throat, the glands swelling, &amp;c. I
have treated, with uniform and rapid success, these
cases with Aconite, followed by Belladonna, and
then by Mercurius.
[Also, Protiodide of Mer. and Tart. Emetic, if the
indications for their use should be present, as laid
down under " catarrhalfever." - Ed.]
Each influenza requires,- according to its peculiar
modifications, its own homceopathic remedies.
There is one point which all should remember;
viz., that the influenza is more dangerous in its efects
than in its first symptoms. Every medical man's experience will demonstrate, that serious affections of
the lungs very often develop themselves after the influenza.* Great care should be taken in eradicating
by appropriate remedies all remaining symptoms.
* The old system practitioners maintain that their miscalled active treatment is necessary to eradicate the maladies. That this
result is not obtained is evidenced most fully by the numerous
cases, that come under treatment at the present period, of which
the patient considers the influenza, for which he or she had the
old system of treatment, as the origin.
