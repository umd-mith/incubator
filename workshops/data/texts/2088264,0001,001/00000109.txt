The following description, by Dr. Hering, of the
attack of hooping-cough, is so graphically correct,
that I have adopted it:
" In real hoopirig-cough, the children have frequent
single paroxysms, before which they run after their
mother, become anxious, grasp at and hold something: then cough violently with a sounding hollow
tone, in such quick succession, that they can scarcely
draw breath again, or only with a long, sobbing,
whistling tone: this is succeeded by great anxiety,
as if they would suffocate, and they become red and
blue in the face. They stretch out the neck far,
everything is strained and cramped, and they can
bear nothing to touch them. These paroxysms end
with struggling and vomiting of mucus, frequently
mixed with blood, which also is often discharged
from the nose. Afterwards the children are again
lively: but, owing to their throwing up everything
they eat or drink, they become, as the attacks are
frequent, weaker and much debilitated."
Dr. Hering recommends to try Veratrum first, as
its operation is speedy: to give one globule, and
wait till the next attack: then give a second globule,
and wait twenty-four to thirty hours: if the cough
improves, not to repeat the dose till the cough is
worse again.
This course of administration applies to the other
remedies for hooping-cough.
Among these remedies, Drosera is a most valuable
remedy, especially when the whoop is well defined. I
have cured many with it.
To direct in the choice of the appropriate remedy,
the following tables will be useful: particularly noticing, that, when one remedy ceases to improve the
symptoms, another is to be carefully sought.
