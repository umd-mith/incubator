manifestations, during the first epoch of infancy, which extends to the sixth month, may be regarded as most natural,
and indeed nearly vegetative; it draws its sustenance from the
mother,-or if that natural source is cut off, artificial nourishment as nearly assimilating this aliment as possible,
should be substituted, and the greatest care should be observed in this preparation, for sometimes the most bland and
nicely prepared will not agree with the delicate and sensitive infantile structure. The bones are in a course of
hardening during this epoch; strength is gradually imparted to the vital phenomena, and its mental manifestations are nearly adapted to the expression of instinctive
desires - pleasure or pain. At this epoch the existence of
disease is made manifest by the position of the body and limbs;
the expression, the openness, the contraction, the brightness,
or the dullness of the eye; the cry; the changes of countenance, manifested by a peculiar smiled; the drawing up of the
limbs; the sudden scream; the restlessness and the state
of the pulse and respiration; all must be consulted. The
vomiting which so frequently occurs during the first six
months, should not be regarded as disease; it is a provision
of nature, and affords relief to an overloaded stomach;
hence, if the nurse is healthy, disturbance of the bowels is
not common during this period, unless physic has been
given, and thus one of nature's most perfect works interfered with. The question might well be asked here, why
man, the only thinking being, should be the only disorderly
work of Almighty Creation. The lower orders of mammalia are never thought worthy of a dose of calomel or castor oil to purge off the meconium, and yet they remain
healthy in more than a hundredfold greater percentage
than the human species. The mother's milk is provided by
nature for this purpose, and should never be interfered with.
On this subject pages might be written; we might go
through a history of our race from our first parent, through
all the steps of civilization to show the important influence
which interference with nature has had upon natural
developments. The lining membrane of the alimentary
canal is abundantly protected during this period with mu
