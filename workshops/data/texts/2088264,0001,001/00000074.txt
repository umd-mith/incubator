A third, very troublesome, affection of the head is
known under the name of
MEGRIM.
It is characterized by affecting one side of the
head, and of that only a portion, which the patient
states he can cover with his finger, and feels as if a
nail was being driven into the part. The part affected is generally very tender, so that not the slightest pressure can be borne.
This malady is generally connected with a constitutional condition, which requires removal; but, in
affording relief, the characteristics, already given of
headache, will be of utility.
