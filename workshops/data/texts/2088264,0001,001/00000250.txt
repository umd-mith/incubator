Vexation has caused the same effects, and also
violent attacks of asthma, and, more frequently,
looseness of the bowels.
Chamomilla is found to be the most effectual remedy for diseased states, brought on by passion or vexation: and this because the effects, produced by it
on a healthy person, are similar to the effects produced by passion and vexation: chamomilla being
the more particularly useful, when purging and colicky pains are produced as the consequences of the
vexation.
When, however, rage is associated with vexation,
and is followed by shivering and coldness over the
greater part of the whole of the body, then Bryonia
is the best remedy: bryonia is particularly suited
where constipation is consequent upon the vexation.
If the rage is attended with indignation, so violent
that the party dashes away that which he held in his
hand, as children often do, then Staphysagria is the
best remedy.
SILENT GRIEF,
is another cause of disease.
In this case the party retains within herself or himself the grief: the indications are occasional sighs,
flushed cheek on one side, pale on the other: constipation.
Ignatia in such cases is the remedy, because it
produces sighing, the condition of cheek referred to,
constipation, &amp;c.
