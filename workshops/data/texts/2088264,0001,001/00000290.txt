succeed each other? What is the order of their succession? With what intensity, and how long does
each continue? Are they general, or do they affect
particular parts only; with or without thirst? With
paleness or redness of the face and skin? Are there
other symptoms accompanying the paroxysm of fever
(cold, hot, and sweating stage)?
Does the patient sleep long, or is he restless, and is
the sleep interrupted by frequent waking or startings? Does he talk or moan in his sleep, or has he
the nightmare? Is the sleep disturbed by anxious
dreams, aud of what character? In what posture
does the patient lie during sleep? Is he accustomed
to sleep with his mouth open? How is his strength?
Is he obliged to lie down, or can he remain up? Does
he feel languid, weary, or sluggish, &amp;c.? Is he
emaciated?
The patient should relate his previous diseases, -
particular cutaneous diseases- itch, eruptions of
the head, tetter, erysipelas, small-pox, measles, pimples on the face, or any itching eruption of the skin.
By the use of these questions, which show the minuteness of statement on the part of the patient, and
the correspondent minuteness of investigation on the
part of the physician, necessary for the application
of homceopathic means for the cure of diseases, I have
had the pleasure of curing many patients in Ireland,
Scotland, and various parts of England, whom I have
never had the opportunity of personally seeing.
