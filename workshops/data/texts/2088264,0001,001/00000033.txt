Though aconitum is suited to GENERAL febrile
action,* often there is a LOCAL diseased condition, to
which aconitum is not so applicable: take croup for
instance: here is a local afection of the windpipe:
that is, with the general febrile action there is a local
diseased condition, towards the cure of which aconitum is serviceable, so far as it acts on the general
febrile action, and also so far as its symptoms are
liomceopathic to those presented in croup; but there
is another remedy, peculiarly adapted to the local
affection of the windpipe, namely, the symptoms presented in croup: such medicine is Spongia. Spongia is therefore to be given.\ The plan is this: dissolve three globules of spongia in four spoonsful of
water, and take two spoonsful four hours after the
aconitum, or sooner, if the local symptoms increase
notwithstanding the aconite. Wait then six or eight
hours, repeat the aconite solution, one spoonful, and
four hours after, the spongia solution, one spoonful:
if progress is being made, wait twelve hours, and, if
any of the original symptoms remain undiminished,
give the remaining dose of the aconite, and follow,
four hours after, with the remaining dose of the
spongia.
In some violent diseases, such as spasms, cramps,
* General febrile action is exhibited in the following symptoms: First, constant burning heat of the whole body with redness of the skin; second, distention and redness of the face in
particular; third, eyes glistening and prominent; fourth, dry
tongue most frequently, sometimes coated with mucus; fifth,
great thirst; sixth, want of appetite; seventh, constipated or absent stools; eighth, urine heating, and passed in small quantities;
ninth, sleeplessness; tenth, jactitation or tossing about; and eleventh, anxiety. - HARTMANN.
