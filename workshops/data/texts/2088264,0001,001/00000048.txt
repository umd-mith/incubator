If the corns resist these means, pursued for a fortnight or three weeks, the inference- is, that they depend upon constitutional disease, and, as such, must
be treated by Sulphur and Silica; Silica being especially indicated if the corns are painful at the change
of weather. Rhus also is useful in pains from change
of weather, and is more immediate.
Should the corns disappear under the use of those
means and grow again, Antimonium Crudum will
be useful: rub a few drops of the first dilution on
the part.
Should the corns at any time, even during the alternate use of Sulphur and Silica, become inflamed
or cause severe pain, especially after exercise, the
use of Arnica will be an excellent auxiliary; a footbath, to which 40 drops of the tincture have been
added, is the best form.
When the skin becomes hardened on the sole of
the foot, then Antimonium Crudum is very useful.
Corns, it should be remembered, depend often on
constitutional causes.
Many other affections of the skin might be noticed;
but these will serve as affording general rules: for
other common cutaneous affections will be seen to be
similar, in most respects, to one or the other of these,
and the treatment can thence be deduced.
One remark particularly demands attention. It is
