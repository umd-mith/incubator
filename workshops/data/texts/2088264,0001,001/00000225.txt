Children, from the great excitability of their frames,
(an excitability dependent upon the great size of the
brain and the great preponderance of the nervous
system,) are peculiarly liable to be acted upon, so
to have induced in them these convulsive attacks.
This infantile nervous excitability is particularly
great at the time of teething, and hence at that time
more particularly these attacks present themselves.
The first thing to be attended to, is that the attendant be calm. Generally speaking there is not
much danger, unless the attack continues very long,
or unless attack succeeds attack, and each succeeding attack becomes more severe.
[Nothing shows the importance of close observation, with a view of ascertaining and removing the
cause, than the management of the disease. If it
be teething, the first thing to be done is to scarify
the gums freely. This may be done with a sharp
penknife, and all fear of future convulsions will often
cease. One dose of Chamomilla will aid in preventing its return.
If the stomach is overloaded with improper food,
unripe fruit, &amp;c., of course wisdom at once dictates
its removal in the most speedy manner and with as
little suffering to the little patient as possible. This
will often be accomplished by spontaneous vomiting
as soon as the first convulsion ceases, particularly if
the throat be gently excited by a feather dipped in
sweet oil. If vomiting does not come on, however,
by these means, it must be excited, and the stomach
emptied, or another convulsion will quickly follow,
more terrific than the first, which, at every repetition,
more and more endangers the structure of the brain.
