fact, that Homeoopathy is a part of the Divine
Truth: an axiom, demonstrated elsewhere.*
Though Homoeopathy is thus efficient, many, and
those often the enemies of Homceopathy, attempt to
discredit it, because it is not all effcient. If any
patient dies under homceopathic treatment, they insinuate that death came because of the want of
active treatment: though perhaps the very objectors
have had relatives or friends die of the very disease,
and though the registrar's tables show that the disease has been decidedly fatal in the common, this
miscalled active-treatment, practice. All the cures
performed by homoeopathic means are not remembered: all the victoiies gained are swallowed up in
the one unsuccessful repulsion of Death. This is
prejudice. It must be expected for a few years.
Homoeopathy must bide its time.
