The vaccination, when properly performed, is a
protection against smallpox as effectual as smallpox
itself. Persons have had smallpox a second time;
and some have died of the second attack.
At the Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution, the board of managers have, for the last five
years, given to each child, after vaccination, a powder of sulphur, as a preventive against eruptions;
and when children are brought for vaccination, having at the time eruptions, a powder is given' to be
taken before the operation is performed; and the
benefits resulting in reference to long-standing cutaneous affections, from the use of this sulphur powder,
have been evidenced in numerous cases.
This plan, from the experience of the Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution, where, as Medical Director, I have vaccinated nearly eighty thousand children, I can recommend as worthy of adoption by parents towards their children after vaccination.
TEETHING, OR DENTITION.
About the sixth month the teeth begin to appear.
This development of the teeth, being a natural process, ought to be unattended with pain. Oftentimes
it is attended with severe affections: a circumstance,
dependent generally on the improper diet of the
mother, or on the mismanagement of the child.
The teething seems to direct the life power to the
head, and hence, during teething, affections of the
head very often are developed, and death occurs.
