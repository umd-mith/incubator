REMITTENT FEVER.
This fever differs from the continued by having a
partial cessation or discontinuance of the fever. This
generally occurs during the forepart of the day. The
fever does not leave the patient entirely as it does in
intermittent; there are alternate chills and flushes,
but very little or no perspiration, while the bilious
symptoms are generally very prominent.
Nux Vomica, in addition to the remedies above
directed for the other forms of fever, will be necessary, in this fever, at the commencement, followed by
Antimony Tart., which is a very important remedy
where there is nausea; vomiting, diarrhcea, and other
symptoms, similar to cholera.
Veratrum, also, for the same purpose as the last,
and when headache and griping in the bowels attend.
Arsenicum, as soon as there is a distinct intermission of the fever, one or two doses must be given
during that period.
When this disease occurs in infants it is called
"Infantile remittent fever," and then, under the following complications, requires Protiodide of Mercury:
If the abdomen should be distended; tympanitic; or
have a hard and knotty feel; and the alvine evacuations should look green-blackish; tarlike; or mucous and bloody, and attended with straining and
frequent disposition to stool; also if there should be acough during exacerbation of fever, with rattling in
the chest, or any evidence of the development of
tubercles in the lungs.
Chamomilla, if the child should be teething, and.have green stools and some of the above symptoms.
