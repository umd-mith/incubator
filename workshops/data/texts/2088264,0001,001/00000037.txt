amelioration progresses, we should not repeat the
remedy, or at least we must increase the interval between the doses.
But it may be inquired, how is the homceopathic

disease. Hahnemann gives the rules:

The remedial aggravation occurs almost immediately after the administration of the remedy, and

seen to arise from some
new agent operating.
The remedial aggravavation presents an   increase of the same symptoms, which, after three
to four hours, present a
lessened strength.

The progress of disease aggravation proceeds
on regularly: and bears
the same ratio of progress
after as before the exhibition of the remedy.
The progress of disease aggravation presents
an addition often of new
symptoms.

These are the chief distinctions: there is another,
which powerfully helps to distinguish the aggravation
as remedial, and this is, that some of the symptoms of
the remedial agent, distinct from those, in which it
is homceopathic to the disease, become manifest in
the patient.
This additional evidence is principally available to
the homceopathic physician, because it cannot be
supposed that non-medical individuals are likely to
be acquainted with these symptoms.
If, however, in four hours after administration, no
effect should be produced by the medicine, either
