The Ascaris or the thread worm is a short worm
about an inch long. It produces an itching, and a
frequent inclination to relieve the bowels.
The Lumbricus is like.an earth worm, only white,
the head being studded with slight eminences. It
fastens itself to the intestines, and by its motion and
sucking, produces painful griping about the navel.
The 1Tcnia, or tape-worm, is flat, white, and
jointed. It is very difficult to recognize its existence by symptoms: the only positive proof of its
existence is the discharge of portions.
Worms are looked upon with considerable horror.
