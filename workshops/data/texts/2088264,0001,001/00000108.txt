If the cough at the commencement is moist, easily
loosened, and begins after a violent cold, and is attended with hoarseness, Dulcamara will be most useful.
Nux Vomica will be serviceable, if the cough is
dry, and attended with vomiting and anxiety, so
severe as almost to induce sufocation: also, if the
sufferer from the beginning turns almost blue in the
face, and if the cough occurs after midnight, continuing till the morning (15. p. 98.) If, after the nux
vomica, the cough becomes loose and moist, Pulsatilla (1. p. 96) will become appropriate: and if there
is bleeding from the nose and the mouth. Pulsatilla
also is to be preferred to Nux Vomica, if, besides the
cough being loose and moist, vomiting of mucus and
of the contents of the stomach, and a mucous diarrhcea
present themselves.
Should the VOMITING cease, but the ANXIETY, approaching to suffocation continue, Ipecacuanha (24.
p. 100,) will then be useful.
Should these means be ineffectual, and the cough
occurs as a spasm in single attacks, most during the
day, the evening, and the frst part of the night, attended with a redness of, and pains in, the throat
when swallowing; also with watering of the eyes,
Carbo Vegetabilis can be given, and repeated in
twenty-four hours. This medicine is particularly
serviceable when children " complain of a pricking
in the head, pains about the chest and in the neck,
and, at the same time, have eruptions on the head
and the body. It is a sovereign remedy when the
hooping-cough is on the decline." (Dr. HERING, of
America.)
When, however, the hooping-cough is fully developed, other medicines are required.
