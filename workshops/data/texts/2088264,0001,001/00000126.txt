has convinced me, are Calcarea and Belladonna,
used alternately.
TOOTHACHE.
Hollow teeth are peculiarly subject to this affection. Taking cold is generally stated as the cause.
The symptoms of toothache vary much: the following tabular view will serve to help in the selection of the appropriate remedy.
These tables will show that Mercurius and Sulphur are the two medicines, most extensively curative of toothache. Mercury, it should be remembered, being so injuriously prescribed by so many
practitioners, is the cause of numerous toothaches.
It should therefore be always ascertained whether
the patient has or has not been mercurialized previously to prescribing Mercurius.
Next to sulphur stands Nux Vomica: and next to
nux vomica, Pulsatilla: next to it, Staphysagria.:
then Belladonna, Bryonia, Chanmomilla, and Rhus
Toxicodendron.
Persons, liable to toothache, should abstain from
cofee: toothache being one of the effects of cofee.
