physic, of being pillaged, both as to purse and his
remaining health, it affords an excuse to the disappointed patient for leaving the diseased state to progress without disturbance on his part, till permanent
organic mischief is produced; the excuse being
based on the idea, deduced from the past want of
success, that there is no cure.
Dyspeptics should ever remember, that diseases almost always progress, when unaided: true, many
dyspeptic patients get well when they " throw physic
to the dogs;" but then, they had not dyspepsia, they
had physicpepsia: and, desisting from physic, the
affection, caused by physic, ceases: and the previous
state, now minus physic, is found to the patient's
astonishment, to be HEALTH.
The stomach, however, is often in a diseased
state; and, when in this state, certain symptoms
present themselves, to which the pathogenetic effects
of certain medicines correspond. These effects of
medicines may be enumerated, and thence may be,deduced the kinds of derangement, curable by each
medicine. Nux Vomica, Pulsatilla, Bryonia and
'Chamomilla, are the principal remedies; the symp-,toms, suited to each of them, are recorded.
Ipecacuanha is useful when there is much nausea
%and vomiting. Ignatia often follows Pulsatilla with
effect.
Sulphur must always be employed, where, after
the use of the previous medicines, the disease remains, more particularly if there are eruptions.
When tea has been the cause of dyspepsia, then,China is a valuable remedy.
