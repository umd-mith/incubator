are much more frequent than they were sixteen or
eighteen years ago."
To these valuable remarks may be appended the
following statements of Dr. Andrew Combe: "The
Romans were so well aware of the mischief caused
by compression of the waist during gestation, that
they enacted a positive law against it; and Lycurgus,
with the same view, is said to have ordained a law
compelling pregnant women to wear very wide and
loose clothing."
To conclude: the female should remember that
child-bearing is a process of health. The formation
of a child in the womb, when the exciting cause has
been applied, is as natural and as healthy an action
as the formation of chyme by the stomach when the
food has been introduced into it; and therefore, this
condition should not be regarded with a feeling of
anxiety, but rather should be looked upon as a means
of developing health; and that this is the case is
rendered evident by the fact, that a female, who has
brought a child into the world, presents a few days
after, in her countenance, a peculiar freshness and
clearness, that must strike even the most casual
observer.
