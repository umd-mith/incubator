In reference to diet, the mother should avoid
both all stimulating foods and all excess of food not
stimulating.
In regard to stimulating foods, many think these
are justified by the peculiarities of appetite existing
during the period of pregnancy. But these peculiarities are not the products of health, but the consequences of disease, and, as such, should be treated
medicinally and morally; not pampered by articles of
diet, which augment the diseased states, upon which
these peculiarities are dependent.
Another decisive evidence that stimulating foods
or drinks are injurious, because unsuitable, is afforded in the fact, that the pulse of the pregnant female
is much more rapid than the usual pulse of the same
female when not pregnant.
Plain, nutritious, unstimulating food, should be
the constant source of nourishment to the pregnant
female. And this food should not be taken in larger
quantities than usual. Many think that, because a
pregnant female has to nourish a second being, she
needs this increase of supply: but it must be remembered that during the period of healthy pregnancy,
the natural monthly discharge, common to women,
ceases; and the cessation of this must be almost, if
not quite an equivalent, to the increased demand upon
the constitution by the living being.
The food should be nutritious and digestible. Indigestible articles of diet, by producing an excruciating colic, have, as Dr. Eberle has proved by several
remarkable instances, produced abortion, even so
early as the fourth month: a result still more likely
to happen, as the period of pregnancy advances nearer
to its termination.
