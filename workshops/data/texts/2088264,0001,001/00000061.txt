It is particularly troublesome towards evening and
night.
As this eruptive affection is attended with fever,
when the symptoms indicated by Aconite occur in a
strong degree, Aconite can be given first, followed
by Dulcamara or by Nux Vomica; Dulcamara being
indicated, according to Dr. Jeanes, under the following circumstances: the eruption preceded by a
sensation of sticking as with needles; attended with
fever; with a bitter taste in the mouth, a slimy,
coated tongue; nausea; vomiting; pressing pains at
the pit of the stomach; diarrhoea; dark, cloudy urine;
pains in the limbs; extreme itching; and after
scratching, burning.
When, however, there is headache, constipation,
thirst, hoarseness, and when the eruption has appeared from taking stimulating or indigestible substances,
then Nux Vomica or Pulsatilla is to be taken after
the Aconite.
Should the eruption have suddenly disappeared,
and symptoms indidating affection of the chest make
their appearance, Bryonia will be highly serviceable.
If with headache there is a red face, then Belladonna.
EXTERNAL INJURIES produce affection of the skin
and parts beneath, which require domestic attention.
The first affection embraces
THE BURN AND THE SCALD.
The treatment of the burn and the scald differs
according to the severity: this being dependent
considerably upon the surface injured.
