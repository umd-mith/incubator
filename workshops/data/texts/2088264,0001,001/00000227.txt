my observation, when this condition was present,
viz., cold perspiration upon the forehead, and cold
limbs, with retching and alternate crying or screaming. One drop of the tincture in a wineglass of
water, and one teaspoonful of this should be given
every half hour until relief is obtained. This last
remedy may also be given for heat in the head, with
great restlessness, which symptoms are the common
precursors of convulsions.- Ed.]
If homoeopathic remedies are not at hand, the old
practice of immersing the feet and legs in hot water,
taking care to wipe them perfectly dry afterwards,
and to wrap them up warm, can be adopted: and, to
this can be added, if relief is not obtained, the pouring of cold water on the top of the head, and the
smelling of Camphor: this last often relieves the
violence of the fits.
But the best plan is to use homceopathic remedies,
many of which have a specific power over convulsions.
Among these Belladonna, Chamomilla, Cina, Cicuta, Viroso, Ignatia, Mercurius, stand preiminent.
Chamomilla is, generally speaking, the most suitable.
Cina and Cicuta are particularly useful where
worms are present: cina being particularly indicated
when the little sufferer habitually zoets the bed. Stiffness of the limbs and of the whole frame is another
characteristic.
In the more violent attacks, the medicine may be
given during the attacks; but, more generally, after
the attack, or in the interval between one attack and
the other.
