Bry., Nux Vom., Phos. Sabina, Sulp., Canth., Colchi.,
and Arnica.
If the disease disappears suddenly from the surface and attacks the internal organs, give Nux Vom.
Ambra. or Bell. -Ed.]
The next affection is
LUMBAGO.
This is an inflammatory affection of some muscles
of the loins: and manifests itself by violent, fixed,
drawing, tearing pains in the loins and the sacrum,
extending to the back and shoulders down to the
thighs. It is attended often with an affection of the
bladder, cramps being produced; difficulty in the discharge of urine, with an inclination to go to stool:
the thigh afterwards feels weak, numbed, &amp;c., and
the sufferer cannot bend or extend the limb. The
pain in the back becomes so very bad, that he cannot
lie on it: fever supervenes: there is strong thirst:
the pulse is hard, full, and incompressible.
To subdue the febrile symptoms, Aconite must be
repeatedly employed, if necessary.
When the pains are worst during motion, Bryonia
and Nux: when worst in a state of rest, Rhus, and
Pulsatilla: when insufferable during the night,
Mercury and Chamomilla: when the pains are pulsative, and suppuration threatens, Staphysagria:
when spasmodic affections of the bladder appear,
then Cantharides.
When the pains occur after lifting a heavy weight,
then Arnica is invaluable: this is also serviceable
where the pain is so violent that the patient dares not
sneeze, cough, or walk.
