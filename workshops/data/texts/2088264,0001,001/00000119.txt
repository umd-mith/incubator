difficult breathing, palpitation of the heart, anxiety,
saltish or sweetish taste in the mouth, tickling in the
fauces, and cough, bringing up blood.
Aconite is the best remedy: it subdues the general
increased action very effectually.
China and Pulsatilla are the remedies most frequently useful after the hemorrhage. The selection
may be deduced from the following table:

China.
Patient shivers.

Patient has transitory
heats.
Short sweats.
Inclined to lie down.
Limbs tremulous.
Sanguineous excitement
lessened.
Expectorates blood, more
or less, every day.

Pulsatilla.
Shiverings with general
debility.
Blood expectorated, deeply colored and in clots.
Shootings in the chest,
and an uneasiness in the
lower part of the chest.
Difficult breathing.
Feet cold.
Oppressed with grief.
Inclined to tears.
Women, whose menses
are suppressed.

I have very great confidence in the use of Aconite
