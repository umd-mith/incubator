CHAPTER VII.
DISEASES OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM.
BESIDES the affections already enumerated, there
are a few, belonging to the
MUSCULAR SYSTEM.
These are
1. Rheumatism. 2. Gout. 3. Lumbago.
RHEUMATISM
is an affection very extensive in its range, embracing
the muscles, their coverings, the tendons, the ligaments, and in some cases, affecting the membrane
investing the bones.
Sometimes the affection is limited to a few muscles,
and then the sufferer finds relief from the non-use of
those muscles.
Sometimes the affection is so extensive, that the
patient cannot move himself in any direction without
excruciating pain.
Pain on motion is the most striking feature; diminution or cessation of pain on rest, a weakness remaining, are other features.
The heat of the bed generally increases rheumatic
pains.
Rhematism is generally a very obstinate disease.
