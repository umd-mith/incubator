aggravating decidedly the symptoms, or diminishing
decidedly the symptoms, it is certain that the remedy,
homeopathic to the disease, has not been selected,
or that some circumstances, such as diet, (see chapter on Diet,) have interfered with the operation. It
will be necessary then to go over the symptoms of
the patient again, and to compare these symptoms
with some other remedy or remedies, so as to find the
one most homceopathic to the symptoms.
If, still, after the most careful examination, the
symptoms are most correspondent with those of the
homanopathic remedy first chosen, it may be that the
Swant of effect depends upon the diminished susceptibility to impression, dependent upon the exhaustion
of the life power; it will then be well to give a drop
of the dilution itself, instead of the globules impregnated with the given dilution. But, in such a case,
a physician's aid is sure to be sought.
In regard to diet, the particulars, to be attended to,
will be found in the Fourth Part.
It is necessary always to select articles of diet in
which the nutritive property, unattended by strong
flavors, preponderates.
Cocoa is the best of all flavored drinks. It is
highly nutritive. It contains an oil and a fecula,
compounded in such suitable proportions, that the
most delicate stomach will, after a time, bear them
thus joined. At first, sometimes, the stomach does
not seem to agree with the cocoa; a little perseverance, and the stomach will submit. The author of
this work takes cocoa three times each day, no tea,
no coffee, no beer, and no liquid at dinner.
