* A sixth malady of the skin is
THE BOIL, (FURUNCULUS.)
A red spot in the skin, hard and painful, appears:
it rises and swells, and becomes a painful, well-defined, pointed tumor, being highest in the centre, of
a deep red color, ending, for the most part, in suppuration; a head forming in the centre, which being
removed, pus, mixed with blood, is discharged.
Arnica will promote the healing, and prevent the
return. Arnica being unsuccessful, and if, with the
boil, there is an enlargement of the glands in the
neighborhood of the boil, Belladonna will, in most
cases, cure.
If the inflammation still persist, and the boil is
very large, and there is feverish heat, then aconite
an( hepar sulphuris, as directed for the whitlow, will
be serviceable.
Often Mercurius, after arnica or belladonna has,
or arnica and belladonna have, exercised the full extent of its or their beneficial agency, without perfectly curing, will complete the curative process.
Sulphur is useful after the Arnica.
It should be remembered that boils indicate a constitutional state, which should be eradicated, because,
while remaining, there is always a liability to attack
from other diseases: for this the physician must be
consulted.
