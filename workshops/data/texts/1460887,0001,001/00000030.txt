us in an order of succession known in advance...
frequently, as if taken with sailors' home-sickness,
Beethoven risks his bark in a final and rapid excursion (Coda of development)... At times even, when
the last stroke of the kettle-drum is sounded, he owns to
us that he feels as it were a profound regret, it
seems to him that be has not said all that he wished
to say.
Wagner follows Beethoven in the employment
of this symphonic system of motives and developments;
his originality  consists in  having applied it to a
precise dramatic action, which unfolds itself on the
stage, while the orchestra, even better than the antique chorus, comments on it, explains it, lights it
up even in its most hidden recesses; it is thus that
Wagner, by a magic altogether natural, succeeds
in suggesting to us, with surprising instantaneousness
and certainty, the sentiments, the thoughts which
he desires us to have, in rendering present to us
things that are remote, in enabling us to read with
the most lucid assurance in the soul of his personages: all the resources of music, past and present,
joined to those discovered by Wagner himself, are
brought together to co-operate to this end. There are
no more obscurities, no more enigmatical oddities:
every thing is to be explained; if anything were
not clear, it would be the fault of the drama.
