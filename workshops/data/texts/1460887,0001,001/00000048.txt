That it begins to work and to live,
That he would gladly show it forth.
He had a faithful, prudent eye,
And was, affectionate enough
To contemplate purely many things,
And again to make all things his own;
Had, too, a tongue which into words
With ease and nicety bverflowed;
Wherefore the Muses, much rejoiced,
Willed he should Master-singer be.
A youthful woman now appears,
With bosom plump and body round;
Firmly she stands upon her feet,
Erect, with noble step she treads,
Not moving to and fro her train,
Nor casting glances all around.
She bears a mete-rod in her hand,
Her girdle is a golden band,
A crown of corn-ears on her head,
Her eye shone as the light of day;
Men call her strenuous honesty,
Bounteousness too, and probity.
She, kindly greeting, enters in,
Nor does this take him by surprise,
For, as she is, so good and fair,
He's seen her, thinks he, long before.
