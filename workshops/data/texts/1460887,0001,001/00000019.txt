bearing date of i680, illustrated by views of Nuremberg, and by prints of Peter Fischer's monument
in St. Sebaldus, of Adam Kraft's tabernacle in St.
Laurentius, etc. The portion relating to the Mastersingers comprises about 150 pages, and includes
numerous poetical and    even  musical quotations.
Mention is made of Wolfram von Eschenbach, of
Walther von der Vogelweide, of Meister Klingsohr,
of Hans Sachs, of the tabulature, of the thirty-two
faults that may be committed, and of the punishments of
them; we find in it, moreover, a long list of tones or
modes with curious names, such as, the tone of the
knight's blue spur; the most comical ones are cited in
David's enumeration in the first act of Wagner's work.
It is probable that a copy of this curious work
exists in the library of the master, with annotations
by his hand.
II.
The Piece.
The action, then, takes place at Nuremberg,
towards the middle of the I6th century; of the
three acts, the third is assigned to St. John's day,
the two others to the eve of this festival, which is
at once that of the city and of Sachs.
