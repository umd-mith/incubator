development of the motive of incipient love (I). After
the pompous conclusion of this exposition in the
principal key of C-major, page 4, a series of delicious modulations rapidly introduces, in E-major,
the motive of declared passion (III), which   is soon
followed by that of impatient ardor (II), such as it
takes  on   shape  in the first act in the Hymn to
Spring; the development of this latter motive leads
us into the key of E-flat major, in which returns,
scherzando, in a quicker and    playful rhythm, the
motive of the Masters (IV), written in diminished values, treated  in fugue style, and alternating with
the  free  melody of the motive of impatient ardor.
This episodic page, a genuine scherzo, a ravishing
prattling of wind-instruments, breaks into a dazzling
explosion when the motive of the Masters (IV), thundered out by the powerful voice of the brasses, reappears in its full majesty, at first isolated, afterwards   combined   simultaneously with  the  motive of
declared passion (III) and that of the banner (V), in a
final apotheosis.
There is, then, nothing simpler than the musical
