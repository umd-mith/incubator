The subject of the first act, which is represented
in a side aisle of St. Catherine's church, is Walther's
declaration of love, his presentation at the trial of
admission to the mastership, his defeat.
The second act takes place almost in the open
air, at nightfall, at a place showing Pogner's house
and Sachs's workshop; we are present at Beckmesser's serenade, at the nocturnal uproar which it provokes, at Walther's attempt to carry off Eva, at
the paternal intervention on the part of Sachs, which
frustrates the insane freak.
In the third act we are in the very workshop
of the shoemaker-poet: it is the morning of St. John's
day. We see the young knight appear; carried off
by Sachs at the height of the hubbub of the night
before, he has just passed the night under his roof,
he has had a beautiful dream; he tells, or rather
sings it: it is this song, modified by the wise counsels of friend Sachs, that is to bring over to Walther
the vote of the Masters /and gain for him the favor
of the populace. -  In fact, by a change of scene
we are transported to the great meadow      on the
banks of the Pegnitz: we are present at the rejoicings of the people, at the filing off of the corporations: the competition is then opened, Beckmesser
sustains the most piteous of defeats, Walther is proclaimed the happy spouse of Eva.
