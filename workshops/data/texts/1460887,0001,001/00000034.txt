Returning to the classification proposed fartherup, I shall insist especially upon the principal motives,
which will be indicated by means of Roman figures,
reserving  to  myself to  quote only   such  of the
secondary motives which shall seem to me the most
interesting, and which I shall mark by means of
Arabic figures. I proceed, then, to follow up the motives in this way, act by act.
FIRST ACT.
Three principal motives, three love-motives, follow
each  other closely in the beginning of the first
scene; they are three nuances, three gradations cor--
responding to three distinct phases in the history
of the reciprocal passion of Walther and Eva; this.
history is presented to us in them as it were in
epitome, in one single picture.
I. Motive of incipient, tender and restrained love,.
as yet ignorant of itself and in doubt:
It appears for the first time on page     I; its cul--
minating point is on pages 14 and 15, in notes of
doubled length; it figures for the last time, like a
fugitive recollection, at the beginning of page 457.
