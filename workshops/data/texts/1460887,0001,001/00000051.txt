I give thee, for thy inmost being,
Viands, and healing remedies,
That filled with joy thy soul may be,
Like as a bud regaled with dew."
Then shows she him, behind his house,
To the back door pointing quietly,
In the narrowly enclosed garden
A blooming maiden seated, waiting
By the streamlet, near the elder-bush;
With head and eye bent to the ground
She sits beneath an apple-tree,
And the world about her scarcely heeds;
Into her lap she's roses plucked,
And with great skill a garland binds,
Adding thereto bright buds and leaves:
Whose shall the wreath of roses be? -
Thus sits she, calm within herself,
With teeming hope her bosom heaves;
So full of presage is her soul,
She knows not what she should desire,
And in the course of many a whim
At times perchance she heaves a sigh.
Why is thy brow so overcast?
That which disturbs thee, sweetest one,
Is perfect joy and blessedness
Prepared and waiting thee in one
