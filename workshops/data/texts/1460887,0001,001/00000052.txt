Who, tossed by many a cruel fate,
Sweet solace in thine eye shall find;
Who must, by means of many a kiss
Of transport, be made whole again.
When he thy slender form inifolds,
From every pain he finds relief;
When into thy fond arms he sinks,
New life and vigor he imbibes,
And unto thee returns new joy
Of youth, returns thy mirthfulness.
With teasing and with many a prank
Shalt thou now vex, now gladden him.
Thus shall love never know old age,
Nor shall the poet e'er grow cold!
While thus he lives in quiet joy,
See, floating in the sky above,
An oaken wreath, forever green;
With it posterity him crowns,
And to the frog-pool banishes
All who their Master have ignored.
(Goethe,.Vermischte Gedichte.)
