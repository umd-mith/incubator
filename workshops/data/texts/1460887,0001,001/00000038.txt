St. John's motive is allied a secondary motive, the
patronal motive of Nuremberg, which we     shall find
again in the 2d act).
VII. Motive, of the presentation of Walther to the
Masters, a knightly motive, applicable exclusively to
the person of Walther:
The knight has but to make his appearance (page 9o),
his figure, his good looks bespeak his race, and
arouse the jealousy of base souls; thus, when Beckmesser, dissimulating a wicked joy, rises to fulfil
his office of mnarker (104), the above motive, distorted
as to melody, as to harmony, and even as to rhythm,
expresses the opposition of a surly and cunning countenance to a prepossessing and frank one.
VIII. The motive of Sachs's goodnzess:
T
Here (page 124, measure 9), it is a growing goodwill towards Walther; in the 3d act, scene 2, this
good-will will have grown into an affectionate friendship; the motive will be at its full.
