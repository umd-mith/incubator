In treating the   subject of Tannhauser, in      describing  the,poetical and    musical rivalry    of the
Wartburg, in bringing on the stage these aristocratic
Minnesingers, ) which     corresponded to the Troubadours of the IIth--14th century, was Wagner led
to think of their homely successors, the dull-witted
i"Master-singers"?... It cannot be doubted.
Having once made up his mind upon this point,
he had at his disposal, from the stand-point of local
color, a precious source of information: we mean the
work by Johann Christoph Wagenseil (1633-1708),
who became the historiographer of the Confraternity.
The book     is entitled: De sacri romani imperii liberd
civitate Noribergensi commentatio. Accedit de Germanice
phonascorum (Meistersinger) origine, prcestantid, utilitate et
institutis, sermone vernaculo liber.  Altdorfii Noricorum,
typis impensisque Jodoci Wilhelmi Kohlesii (1697). )
It is a veritable book de luxe, adorned with a
portrait  of the   author   engraved    by J. Sandrart,
1) Love-singers.
2) Dissertation concerning the free city of Nuremberg, of the
Roman empire. To which is added a book in the vulgar tongue
treating of the origin, excellence, usefulness and rules of the
Singing-teachers (Master-singers) of Germany. Altdorf in Noricum,
printed and published by Jodocus Wilhelmus Kohles (1697).
