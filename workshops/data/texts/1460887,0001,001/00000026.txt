turn, always under pretext of having something
done to her shoes...Sachs indulges in innocent
naughtiness; while he is holding her foot on the
stool and pretending  to find out where the shoe
pinches, Walther appears in full dress... Eva is
taken aback, dumb show: Walther strikes up a new
aud enthusiastic verse regarding his trial-song...
Outburst of emotion;' Eva throws herself into the
arms of Sachs, to whom    Walther holds out his
hand; Sachs disengages himself and causes the
young maiden to lean upon the shoulder of her
lover... But behold David and Magdalena approaching... to the surprise of all, Sachs names
them  as witnesses, he proclaims himself god-father,
with Eva for god-mother: the matter in hand is the
celebration of the symbolical baptism of the poetical
and musical new-born infant, of the mnode (Weise)
invented by Walther this very   morning for the
trial-song, for which mode a name must be found,
according to custom.
In spite of the pleasant, sportive side of the
improvised ceremony, the moment is a solemn one...
A profound, almost religious emotion carries away
the five personages, transports them above themselves, reunites them, mingles them in an extatic
hymn, an outpouring of intimate tenderness and of
supreme hope.
