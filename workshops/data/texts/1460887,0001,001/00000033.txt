connect their occasionally timid and vague apparition
with their apotheosis in the full light of day, their
blossoming with their entire expansion. - Here we:shall have to content ourselves with noting their
apparition, and   with   indicating  their  culminating
point. - The overture, for reasons which I shall
explain, will be treated of in the last place.
In the following analysis, the reading of which
should, as far as possible, take place with the score
in the hand,') I adopt, for the sake of its clearness.and its practical utility, a classification based upon
the greater or lesser importance of the motives in
the course of the work: principal motives (in a great
measure grouped in the Overture), secondary motives,
playing a less essential, and as it were an episodic
part. (We might, indeed, distinguish a third category, motives foreign to the wzork, but it is reduced
to two motives from    Tristan.) -  In a more detailed,
more exhaustive work than this elementary study,
-a simpler, more philosophical classification, going
more to the bottom     of things, would be that into
interior: psychographical, personal motives, and exterior:
descriptive, decorative, episodical ones.
1) Reference is here made to the piano-forte and vocal score
in smaller form, with simplified reduction by R. Kleinmichel,
published by the firm of Schott; it is to this edition that my subsequent indications of pages, etc., apply.
