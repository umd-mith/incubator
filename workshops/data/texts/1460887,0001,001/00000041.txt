XII. Rhythmical motive of the cudgelling, page 238,
12th measure:
it is derived from  the accompaniment of the lute;
it steps in in a decisive manner at the outset of the
7th scene, with David, 259.

of these last two motives form    the grand choral
scene which terminates this act, the scuffle, in which
Beckmesser is beaten by his own motives; (and
with justice, since they are the occasion of all the
disturbance).
