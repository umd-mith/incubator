She speaks: "I have elected thee
From many men in life's turmoil,
That all thy thinking may be clear,
That thou no folly may'st commit.
When others jostle in the throng,
With steadfast look discern thou it;
When others piteously complain,
State thou thy case as if in jest;
Thou shalt make much of honor and right,
In all things plain and simple be,
Goodness and virtue stoutly praise,
And evil call by its own name.
Naught softened down, naught subtilised,
Naught beautified, and naught defaced;
But let the world before thee stand
As it to Albrecht Diirer seemed,
Its stable life and manliness,
Its inner strength and steadfastness.
Thee nature's genius by the hand
Shall safely guide through every land,
Shall show thee all the ways of life,
The wayward tanglements of men,
Their muddles, strivings, thrusting and driving,
Pushing, tearing, crowding and grinding,
How topsy-turvy the turmoil rages,
The ant-hill helter-skelter flounders;
But may it in all things be to thee
