has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. This is the first of the Sonatas (taking them in the order in which they appeared) with an introduction. The Ist bar phrase is the groundwork upon which the whole of the introduction is written. It
is very modulatory in character, ending on the chord of the dominant minor 9th.
B. Rhythmically the Ist subject ends at the end of bar 8. The first 4 bars are constructed upon
tonic pedal point.
C. The connecting episode begins with a repetition of the Ist subject ending upon the dominant, bars
9-17, followed by a passage in C minor, also ending upon the dominant, bars 17-21, repeated, bars 21-25.
Three passages founded upon the Ist subject, bars 25-27 (key of G)-,28-3I (key of Ab), and 32-35 (key of Bl),
and 6 bars, 35-40, principally composed of a repetition of the first cadence, on pedal point (the time being
augmented), lead to the appearance of the 2nd subject.
