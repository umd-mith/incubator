FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The ist subject modulates to D major (bars 11-12), into F major (bars 12-19), then into C major,
eventually ending with full close on tonic (bar 27).
B. The connecting episode commences with a repetition of the final cadence of the Ist subject, bars
28-31, followed at bar 31 by a passage, the commencement of which is taken from bar 3, ending on the
dominant, bar 46-at this bar there is a reminiscence of the Ist subject modulating to the dominant of
B major.
