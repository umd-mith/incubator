FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist movement is not in regular Sonata form; the only other exceptions are Op. 27, No. I and
No. 2; Op. 54, and Op. 109. There is no movement in Sonata form in Op. 26.
B. The "Air" is composed of two sections of 8 bars each, 1-9 and 9-17, ending on full close in the tonic;
it is followed by 2 bars in Bh minor, 17-19; treated in sequence, 19-21; and 6 bars modulating to the
dominant, 21-27, after which the 2nd section of the air is repeated, bars 28-35.
C. Ist variation. Characterised by a demisemiquaver figure which pervades it.
D. 2nd variation. The " Air " (varied) appears in the bass.
E. 3rd variation. Syncopation is employed throughout.
F. 4th variation. Syncopation is freely used. The principal accent occurs on the third beat of each bar.
G. 5th variation. At the close of the variation there is a Coda, bar 36 to the end.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The " Scherzo " is in Aria form.
B. The Ist subject begins in the key of the dominant instead of in the tonic (see also " Allegretto,"
Op. 27, No. 2); bars 1-9 are repeated (varied); bars 9-17.
C. The episode begins with a sequence of 8 bars formed upon the Ist subject.
D. The ist subject re-appears in the bass, with a running semiquaver accompaniment in the treble; it
afterwards (bar 54) appears in the treble, the semiquaver accompaniment being in the bass.
E. The " Trio " is not cast in the mould of any prescribed form.
F. This sequential episode is formed on the rhythm of the Ist subject.
G. A modulating passage of 4 bars, 27-31, leads back to the resumption of the Ist subject.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject commences in AÃ½ minor, it modulates (bar 8) to C0 (relative major), at bar 10 to B
minor, at bar 16 to D major, and at bar 19 to E' major. At bar 22 the Ist part of the subject is repeated
altered so as to end in Ah minor (tonic).
B. The 2nd part is divided into two portions of 4 bars each (both repeated), the former of which ends in
the key of Eh major.
C. Note the double counterpoint, bars 70-73. The part next the bass, bars 70-71, is in the treble,
bars 72-73, and the treble of bars 70-71 is in the part next the bass, bars 72-73. The whole of the Coda is
upon a pedal point.
FOURTH MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject is curiously constructed; the first portion of it, to bar 13, is in 3-bar rhythm, the
last portion, bars 13-29, in 2-bar rhythm (excepting bars I7l-21", which are in 4-bar rhythm); it abounds
in inversions and imitations.
B. The episode is composed of a sequence formed on the Ist subject; bars 29(g'-3I1) are repeated in
the treble, bars 31(8-33a), a I2th higher.
C. The 2nd subject is accompanied by the Ist subject figure.
D. The beginning of the short passage, bars 49-53, on dominant pedal point furnishes the material for
the 3rd subject; it simply leads from the key of the dominant to the key of the tonic.
E. The 3rd subject commences in C minor, bar 81"'. At bar 89 it modulates to G minor (bars 82-89
are repeated). After modulating to the key of F minor it ends, bar 98, in Eh major.
F. Bars 98-1o2 form a passage resembling somewhat that at letter D.
G. This episode is very like that at letter B, extended. Instead of ending in BP major, it ends on
the dominant of tonic key.
H. The Coda is constructed upon tonic pedal point and formed upon the Ist subject
