D. Bars 82-85 form a passage leading to the repetition of the enunciation, after which, with the
addition of bars 88-91, it leads to the development; it is taken from the concluding part of the 2nd
subject.
E. The development, which, is very modulatory in character, commences with a reference to the
ist subject, bars 3-4 of which furnish the materials for bars 94-97; also for bars 98-112. In bars 98-1oo,
bars 3 and 4 are compressed into one bar; also in bars 102-104. In bars o10 and 105 only the 4th bar
(compressed) is used, bars 106-112 having only the 3rd bar (compressed); bar 113 leads to an elaborate
development of the first portion of the second part of the 2nd subject, bars 114-144. A double pedal point
on the tonic and dominant (bars 144-157) prepares for the second entry of the Ist subject. This pedal
point resembles that to be found at the close of the development of the Ist Movement of Beethoven's
Fourth Symphony in Bf.
F. The Ist subject re-appears unaltered until bar 170, at which bar Af is used instead of G, and five
bars are added, ending, bar 176, in the tonic key.
G. The connecting episode begins as before (compare bars 14-21 with bars 176-183). Bar 22, however,
is altered (bar 184), and a bar added-185-leading to the dominant of A minor; bars 186-197 are an
exact transposition of bars 23-34.
H. The 2nd subject re-appears in the key of A major. At bars 202-205 it modulates through A minor
to C major, in which key it ends (bar 245).
J. Bars 245('-25I (see letter D) form a passage ending with an interrupted cadence leading to the
Coda.
K. The Coda is principally formed upon the Ist subject, with one reference to the 2nd subject.
INTRODUCTION       TO   SECOND    MOVEMENT.
A. Bars 1-9 form an introductory passage (bar 7 is interpolated into the rhythm); it is sequential in
form and modulatory; it begins and ends in the tonic key.
B. At bar 9(6' there commences a melody of 8 bars-9g)-I7").
C. At bar 17, overlapping the end of the melody, is a recurrence of the opening passage, which is
developed, and forms another passage ending on the dominant of C, preparatory to the entry of the Ist
subject of the Rondo.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. Nearly all of the Ist subject (which begins and ends in the tonic key) is based upon the initial
phrases, which are repeated with a varied accompaniment at bar 31 and at bar 55. Note the shake formed
on inverted pedal point, bars 51-62.
B. Bars 62-70 form a connecting passage.
C. At the concluding part of this episode in A minor there is a pedal point in the bass, bars 87-98.
D. Bars 98-113 form a passage leading back to the tonic key, formed on Ist subject.
E. The Ist subject re-appears here unaltered.
F. This episode begins with a subject of 8 bars (I75)'-183a)), which proceeds in sequence for 4 bars.
The first phrase of 8 notes in C minor is repeated in F minor (I77W_-I79(1)). The first 4 notes are then
used to commence a modulation to Af major, the subject ending in. that key (I83()). Bars I752)-I83a) are
then repeated with a triplet accompaniment (183(2)-I9I1)). This subject is then inverted as regards its
harmonic character; instead of the keys being in this order- C minor, F minor, and At major-the subject
appears, bars I9I1()-I991, in A,  major, modulating to F minor and ending in C minor. Bars I9I1-I199m1 are
repeated (inverted), bars 199g)-207(), the triplet accompaniment in the upper part being (with slight
alterations) transferred to the underpart; bars 203(2)-207") are repeated (inverted), bars 207(2)-211(1); a
reiteration cf the final cadence brings the episode to a close in C minor.
G. The development begins in AÃ½ major with reference to the Ist subject (in chords), 221-224,
repeated in F minor, 225-228, and in Dt major, 229-232. A sequence in syncopation leads to a new
figure (bar 251); this modulates through several keys, and gives place (bar 269) to another figure, which
eventually modulates to C minor (bar 277). Bars 295-312 consist entirely of dominant harmony, and end
with full close in the tonic key (bar 313).
H. The first subject is shortened, the first 31 bars being omitted.
J. This episode is formed- upon the connecting passage, bars 62-70. Bars 344-352 are varied and
extended, bars 352(8)-377.
K. A connecting passage (bars 378-402) upon dominant pedal point leads to the Coda, " Prestissimo."
L. The Coda is based almost entirely upon the Ist subject. It is referred to (in the original key), bars
403-406; varied, bars 407-410. In the key of F, bars 427(2)-428; varied, bars 429(2)-430. In original key,
bars 431-434; varied, bars 441-464. In the keys of C major (tonic), C minor, Afr major, and F minor, bars
485-506; and in original key, bars 515-522. There are sequences in bars 411-427 and bars 434-440.
