134-141', is succeeded by one based upon the initial figure of the subject, bars I41"'-I45". The subject
appears again in the key of C, bars 145'-149(, followed by the codetta. Another episode of considerable
length leads to the stretto, bars 181-187. After a canonical reference to the codetta, the fugue ends upon
dominant pedal point, 4 bars of arpeggios on the dominant chord lead to the recapitulation.
J. The Ist subject is shortened on its re-appearance here; it proceeds as before for 8 bars, after which
(upon inverted dominant pedal, bars 212("-216) the initial figure appears direct in the bass and inverted in the
treble, imitated a bar's length at the octave in an inner part. A somewhat new treatment of the passage,
beginning bar 32, leads to the connecting episode.
K. The Ist part of the connecting episode, with some harmonic and melodic changes, resembles the
original one; the and part is identical, transposed a 4th higher, ending in tonic key.
L. The 2nd subject (with slight alterations) is transposed into tonic key.
M. The Coda is built upon previous material; it commences with a reference to the Ist subject with the
concluding 5 notes of the 2nd subject in the bass, followed, at bar 298, by the 2nd part of Ist subject, bars
2oý4)-29 (which is omitted in the recapitulation). The, movement ends with tonic pedal point, bar 320
to the end.
