FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject is in two sections; the first section, bars I-5"2; the second section, bars 5"4-9(", ending
on dominant; the latter section is repeated and elongated, ending with full close on tonic.
B. The connecting episode commences with a subject of 2 bars, which is repeated with different
harmony three times, bars 18-25. A passage closely following, beginning in octaves and ending on the dominant, prepares the ear for a reference to the first phrase of the Ist subject, the rhythm of which is used for a
modulation to D major, bars 37("-39(2). Bars 39 4-46l) are formed upon the dominant chord of G major, in
the key of which there follows an episode, leading to the 2nd subject, bars 46(2)-64(
C. The 2nd subject begins with the melody in an inner part. (Note that the concluding 3 notes
of the bass of the preceding episode (bars 63(4-64a)) also form the 3 first notes of the 2nd subject, bars
63")m-64(1). Bars 63")-678) are repeated, bars 67'-718', altered to end in E minor. A sequential passage
modulating into D minor, C major, B minor, A major, and G major, bars 71(4-75, leads to 2 bars in the
latter key (repeated) followed by 2 bars modulating to D major. These six bars are repeated in different
octaves, bars 82-87, and followed by a sequential passage, bars 88-91, leading to a modulation to C major
(where a new figure is introduced, 92(2)-93(2)). This soon gives place to 4 bars in the key of G, which end
the 2nd subject.
D. The Coda begins with a new subject of 6 bars, repeated (varied), bars 107-112. A passage beginning
with the dominant 7th of C major brings the first part to an end in G major (bar I2Iz1').
E. Bars 121-126, passage leading to the repetition of the enunciation.
F. Bars 127-130 form a passage leading to the development.
G. The development begins with a passage suggestive of the commencement of the connecting episode
ending in E1 major, bars 131-138. Five bars (139-143), in the same key, are followed by a fugal treatment
of a subject which is considerably developed (bars I44"4-II48)--the first part founded upon bars 1-3, the
latter part suggested by the first 3 notes of the 2nd subject. At bars I83(4)-187 a passage occurs which
is repeated in different keys, bars 188-195. At bar 208 there is a reference to the Coda, bar ioI. At bar
2I9g4) the fugal treatment of the first part of the Ist subject occurs again, forming a passage leading to the
second entry of the Ist subject.
H. The Ist subject re-appears considerably altered. The beginning of it is accompanied by a figure,
the rhythm of which may be found, among other places, at the commencement of the 2nd subject.
The succeeding bars are differently harmonised as far as the pause (bar 241), and the latter part instead of
ending in the tonic key as before, is elongated, and closes in Gb major.
J. The connecting episode is constructed on much the same material as in the enunciation, transposed
into different keys. It begins in G0 major and ends in tonic key.
K. The 2nd subject re-appears transposed, to begin and end in tonic key.
L. Bars 339 to bar 358 of the Coda resembles that in the enunciation transposed so as to begin and end
in tonic key. Bar 357 is then developed to bar 369, where there is a reference to the commencement of the
original Coda. A scale passage, bars 380-383, leads to some new material. The Coda ends with
reminiscences of the Ist subject.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. Nearly the whole of the first part is constructed upon bars I-2~. The first 8 bars ending on
dominant are repeated an octave higher, slightly altered. Some development follows, bars I5(3S-3r, which
bars are also repeated with slight variation, 3I'8)-47.
