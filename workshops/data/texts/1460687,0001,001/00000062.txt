D. The second subject may be divided into 4 bar phrases throughout. The ist phrase, bars 53-56, is
repeated, bars 61-64, an octave higher. The second phrase, bars 57-60, is repeated, bars 65-68, varied and
inverted. Bars 69-70 are repeated, 71-72, an octave lower; bars 73-74 are repeated, 75-76, slightly altered,
an octave lower.  It ends with a species of Coda of 4 bars, tonic and dominant harmony, in the key
of the dominant.
E. The development begins with new material, after which, bar 95, the 2nd subject appears in B majoi,
first in the bass and then in the treble. At bar o05 there is a reference to the ist subject, leading to its
re-appearance.
F. The Ist subject re-appears with a different accompaniment, and on its repetition in the bass
II6(1-I23"', the accompaniment is again new (the second repetition is omitted).
G. The connecting episode is identical with that in the enunciation, altered so as to lead to the tonic
key instead of the dominant.
H. The second subject is elongated by 2 bars (171-172), otherwise it is literally transposed into tonic key.
J. The Coda, " Poco Andante," is formed upon the first subject.
