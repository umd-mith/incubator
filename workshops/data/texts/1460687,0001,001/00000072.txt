In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject may be divided into two parts. The Ist part, bar 1-4, ending on dominant 7th.
The 2nd part, consisting of a distinct melody of 8 bars (5-I2'"), ending with full close in tonic key.
B. The connecting episode begins with a brilliant arpeggio passage in tonic key, modulating to the
dominant key, in which, after a passage of different character, commencing bar 20, it closes, bar 28.
C. The second subject consists of a passage of 4 bars, extended to 6 bars.  The bass of bar 28 is
repeated at 29, and also (with one note altered) at bar 30. It begins and ends in the dominant key.
D. A new figure is found at the commencement of the Coda, bar 34, repeated slightly altered, bar 35.
E. The development, after two bars of introduction, is devoted to the first part of the Ist subject,
commencing in the key of F minor (bar 40).
F. The Ist subject re-appears, accompanied by a passage resembling that with which the connecting
episode begins. The whole of the subject is considerably varied and elongated. The 2nd part, instead of
being in the key of the tonic, is, bars 63-66, in the key of Db major. At bars 66-70 there is an enharmonic
modulation (A'G# and DbC$) to E major.
G. The connecting episode begins in E major with the same passage as before; in fact, the whole of it
is constructed from the same material, transposed so as to end in A' major (tonic), bar 871).
