__

In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins with a 4-bar phrase, ending on the dominant I"4-5"', followed by the same
phrase transposed a semitone higher, ending in Db major, that key being modulated to by means of the
Neapolitan 6th, bars 54)'-7, which is also the subdominant chord of Dý major. Bars 8-9" are repeated (in
original key), bars Io-11, and at bars I2-13(" in key of tonic. At bar II" is introduced a figure undoubtedly
suggestive of the principal figure of the Ist movement of Beethoven's C minor Symphony. The subject
ends on half-close on the dominant, bar 17. The A, bar 8("',should be written B'J it being the minor 9th
of A.
B. The first few bars of the connecting episode are derived from the Ist subject, 1bars I7(~z25. At
bar 25 there appears a new figure in triplets, forming an inverted pedal point upon the 'dominant of the
V     ir_ ive major, in which key the episode ends, bar 36.  The E  in bar 33()" would be more correctly
written F, minor 9th of dominant of Ah major.
C. The 2nd subject, bars 36("-66, is divided into two parts. The first part, bars 36-51, in Ar major,
bears some resemblance to the figure used at the commencement of the Ist subject. The last 4 bars,
48-51, lead to the key of Ab minor, in which key the second part of this subject begins, and ends, bars
52-66(8"; it forms a complete contrast to the previous part.
