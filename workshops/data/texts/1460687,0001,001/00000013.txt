C. The and subject begins with a 4-bar phrase, 59(4"-63, in E minor, ending in G major, which is
immediately repeated in G major ending in B5 major, bars 63('1-6'7); and in BW  major, ending in D major,
bars 671'-71(); it eventually modulates to E major, in which key it closes with a 4-bar phrase, 85-88,
repeated (bars 85-86 being inverted), bars 89-92.
D. The Coda is formed from previous material.
E. The development is preluded by the repetition of the last three chords of the Coda, transposed into
E minor (bars 123-125). It principally refers to fragments of the Ist subject (bars 5-9); the 2nd subject is
entirely ignored.
F. The Ist subject re-appears shortened and altered. Instead of the passage, bars 2"1-33a), there is a
repetition of the 2-bar phrase, bars 247(2'-249, extended to 3 bars, first in D major, 25o02'-253, and then in A
major (tonic), bars 254(2'-257(), bringing the Ist subject to a close.
G. The connecting episode is altered so as to end in the key of the tonic minor.
H. The 2nd subject re-appears transposed to begin in tonic minor and end in tonic major; it is only
very slightly altered. Compare bars 87-88=91-92 with bars 311-312=315-316.
J. The Coda, transposed into tonic key, is altered in the bass, bars 325-326.
I. Repetitions of the development and recapitulation are unusual, although they will be found in Op.
10, No. 2, Ist and 3rd movements; Op. 57, 3rd movement; Op. 78, Ist movement; and Op. 79, Ist movement.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The first subject begins with two 4-bar phrases, the latter ending in D major, followed by a 4-bar
phrase in A major, which, at bar 12, modulates back to D major. The first two 4-bar phrases then appear
compressed into one phrase of 7 bars, 13-19"'.
B. The 2nd subject commences in B minor, modulating to F sharp minor, bar 23, in which key the
three first bars are repeated in a varied form, succeeded, at bar 26, by another variation of the same material
in G major, which ends in D major, bar 32')', overlapping the entry of the Ist subject.
C. The first subject re-appears unaltered excepting that the parts in bars 8(2-II are inverted.
D. The Coda begins with a development of the figure taken from the ist subject, bars 9-10. At bar 58
there is a reminiscence of the Ist subject in D minor, and at bar 68 the whole of the first two phrases reappear considerably varied, ending with full close in tonic key, bar 75, which is repeated in varied form to the
end of the movement.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. The Scherzo is in Aria form.
B. The Ist subject consists of two 4-bar phrases, the first ending in the dominant, the second in the
tonic key.
C. The development ends at bar 21 where an episode appears in G$ minor, after which a passage consisting of a sequence of dominant sevenths leads back to the tonic key.
D. The short Coda is founded upon the Ist subject.
E. The Trio is in modified Sonata form.
F. The development commences in C major, modulates to D minor, and then back to A minor. The
rhythm of it is identical with that of Part I.
G. The Ist subject re-appears varied and altered so as to end in A minor instead of E minor as before.
FOURTH MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins with a 4-bar phrase ending on half-close on dominant, followed by another
4-bar phrase ending with full close on dominant. A 4-bar phrase on dominant pedal point is succeeded by
another one of the same length similar to bars 1-4, but altered to end in tonic key.
B. The episode begins with a new subject in the tonic key, modulating to the dominant, in which it
ends, bar 26.
C. The 2nd subject commences with a phrase in E major, bars 26(4'-282), which is immediately repeated
(varied) twice. A sequential passage leads to an inverted dominant pedal point preparatory to the second
entry of Ist subject in tonic key.
D. The Ist subject is varied at each repetition.
E. The 3rd subject is based almost entirely upon the figure in bar 57. It commences in A minor and
modulates to C, in which key there is a full close, bar 66 (double bar and repeat from bar 57), this is followed
by a passage (in imitation, bars 68-72) ending in E major, bar 75. Bars 57-61i' are then repeated (with
slight variation), bars 76-8o~'. Bars 68-8o then recur, the last two bars, however, 79-80, are altered, bars
92-93, to end on the dominant. Bars 93-1oo form a passage leading to part 3.
F. The original episode is slightly altered and shortened.
G. The 2nd subject re-appears transposed into the tonic key, it is also slightly altered. Compare bars
27 and 29 with 125 and 127. It ends with full close in the tonic.
H. The Ist subject re-appears considerably varied. At bar 141-142 there is a modulation to F major.
By enharmonic change, bars 145i&gt;-146a modulate back to tonic key.
J. The Coda consists of modulating reminiscences of Ist and 3rd subjects.
