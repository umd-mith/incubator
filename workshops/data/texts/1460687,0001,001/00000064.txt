In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject consists of only 4 bars, 1-4, beginning and ending upon the dominant. Bar I being
repeated at bar 5, and bar 2 at bar 6, altered to end in F$ minor. Note the appearance of the Ist subject
in the introduction to the finale.
B. The connecting episode, which seems to grow out of the Ist subject, is in the dominant key
throughout; it begins with a reference to the Ist subject, after which the initial figure of the 2nd subject is
foreshadowed. It ends with interrupted cadence.
C. The 2nd subject, which is like a continuation of the episode, commences with a 4-bar phrase
16()-20o), followed by a 5-bar phrase, 20o)-25(1, and a 4-bar phrase, 25(')-29l). Out of the 13 bars forming the
2nd subject, o1 of them, 19-29, are constructed entirely upon tonic and dominant harmony of E major.
D. The Coda is formed upon a double pedal point.
E. The development, after 2 bars of the chord of the dominant, commences with several references to
the Ist subject, bars 35-42, after which the first 3 notes of bar 2 are considerably developed.
F. Only the first 2 bars of the ist subject re-appear here, and these are slightly varied,
