C. The 2nd subject, which is in the dominant minor key, instead of being in the relative major (F), is
in two parts, bars 41-55 and 55-87. The rhythm of the Ist part is suggested in the " Allegro" part of
Ist subject.
D. Bars 87-92 form a passage leading to the repetition of the enunciation.
E. Bars 87-88 and 93-96 form a connecting passage between the enunciation and the development.
F. The development begins with a recitative (Largo), bars 97-102, derived from bars 1-2. The greater
part of the succeeding Allegro is of the same character as the regular theme in the connecting episode,
which is also formed upon bars 1-2.
G. The Ist subject re-appears, bar 147, with the 2 Largo bars (1-2) extended to 6 bars (147-152),
followed by the rest of the subject as in the original.
H. The connecting episode begins for 2 bars as in the original one; after this, however, it is of quite a
different character. A recitative of 4 bars, 159-162, gives place to a passage of 4 bars in F# minor, 163-166
(enharmonic modulation, 162-163), repeated (167-170) in G minor, and imitated 171-175, ending upon
dominant harmony.
J. At bars I93("2-96(1) it is thought that the limited compass of the instrument in Beethoven's time
prevented a literal transposition of the passage, bars 59(2)-62()
K. The Coda consists of nothing but the harmony of the tonic chord. It should be noted that the key
of the relative major is not used once during the whole of the movement.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject consists of 2 sections; the first 8 bars, the second 9 bars.
B. The connecting episode commences with a 4-bar phrase in the tonic key, followed by a modulation
to C major upon a pedal point with a characteristic figure.
C. Bars 38-43 take the place of the " working out" portion of the movement, they simply form a
passage consisting of dominant harmony upon dominant pedal point.
D. The 2nd section of the Ist subject has a very elaborate variation in the bass, bars 50-59.
E. The connecting episode, 59-72, is transposed so as to end in dominant key.
F. The Coda is formed from previous material. The passage, bars 80-89, being taken from bars 38-43,
and the following passage, 89-98, from the Ist subject. The last 6 bars are upon a tonic pedal point; the
subdominant, followed by tonic harmony, forming a plagal cadence which often occurs in Codas.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. Note that all the movements in this Sonata are written in Sonata form.
B. The Ist subject is founded upon the initial figure of 4 notes; in fact, the whole movement is
constructed upon it and the figure of 2 notes which commences the 2nd subject.
C. The connecting episode begins in D minor, the initial figure appearing in the bass; at bar 36 it
modulates to C major, in which key it continues to bar 43, where by means of augmented 6th on F, it
modulates to the chord of E major, dominant of A.
D. The 2nd subject, instead of being in the key of the relative major, is in the key of the dominant
minor (see letter C, Ist Movement); it begins with a figure of 2 notes, bar 44(') (see letter B).
E. Bars 88-95 form a passage leading to the repetition of the enunciation, and upon its reiteration into
the development.
F. The development is characterised by the persistent reiteration of the initial figure rhythm.
G. The connecting episode commences with part of what was originally the concluding section of the
Ist subject, bars 16-19, it then modulates-to Bf major; at bars 243(2)-246 the initial figure appears in the bass
in the key of Bf minor.  From   bar 244 it resembles the original episode prolonged with harmonic
changes. It ends upon the dominant chord.
H. The 2nd subject is literally transposed into the tonic key, excepting that in some bars the melody
is slightly altered.
J. Bars 316-323 form a passage leading to the Coda (see 88-95).
K. The Coda commences like the development; at bar 336 there is a dominant pedal point in the bass,
which continues to bar 351, where it appears also in the treble.   The Ist subject re-appears,
bars 35I()-382. After a chromatic scale passage the movement ends with a reiteration of the perfect cadence
founded upon the initial figure rhythm.
