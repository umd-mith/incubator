D. The development, bars 66(4-136, contains references to both the Ist and 2nd subjects as well as to the
connecting episode.  It begins, after an introductory bar, with the first 4 bars of the Ist subject in E major.
Bars 25-32 are reproduced with slight alterations in the key of Dl, bars 94-106. Bars 124-135O1 are entirely
occupied with the chord of the minor 9th of the dominant, accompanied, bars I31('-I35O), by the figure
which appeared, bar II().
E. A pedal point accompanies the whole of the Ist subject on its re-appearance, bars 1361"-140", upon
the dominant, bars I40("-I44C upon Db, bars 145-15282 upon the dominant.
F. The connecting episode, bars 152Ã½"-I75, begins like the original one, but it is extended by 4 bars,
160-165, after which it is transposed so as to end in F major(tonic major).
G. The first part of the 2nd subject appears in tlie tonic major key, bar 175. The second part, bars
191-2058, is in the tonic key.
H. The Coda is constructed upon previous material. The 2nd subject is referred to twice, at bar 2z1(4
in Db major, and at bar 241 in F minor. The Coda ends with 6 bars of tonic harmony.     1
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The air consists of two sections of 8 bars (repeated), each section containing two phrases of 4 bars,
ending with perfect cadence on tonic chord. In bar 6 the Et should be written Fb, as the chord is evidently
that of the German augmented 6th, roots Eb and Bb. This alteration in the notation, however, causes
consecutive 5.ths.withthe bass     In the variations the Bl. in this chord appears as At
B. Syncopation is freely used in the Ist variation.
C. In the 2nd variation the harmony is in arpeggios.
D. The 3rd variation seems to combine the devices used in the two preceding variations-the syncopation of the Ist and the arpeggios of the 2nd, the latter appearing in demisemiquavers. Instead of the
repeat, this variation is written in full, the figures in bars 53)-6Ia" being inverted, bars 6I-69a~, and bars
69-77~, at 77-85.
E. The original melody re-appears without repeats. Instead of the final chord in the tonic, the 3rd
inversion of the minor 9th interrupts the close of the air. This chord is repeated preparatory to the entry
of the 3rd movement in F minor.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. There is no break between the 2nd and 3rd movements.
B. The Introduction commences with the 3rd inversion of the dominant minor 9th. This chord is
repeated thirteen times. A scale passage constructed upon it finally resolves on the tonic at bar 20.
C. The Ist subject may be divided into two parts. The first part begins and ends in the tonic key,
bars 20-28(~, repeated with alterations in the bass, bars 28-36C). The second part also begins and ends in
the t"foickey, bars 36-5o0", repeated (varied), bars 50-64.
D. The connecting episode is entirely founded upon the first 2 bars of the Ist subject, accompanied by
the harmony of the tonic chord for 4 bars, 64-67, the dominant chord of C minor, bars 68-71, and the
chord of C minor, bars 72-75.
E. Instead of being in the relative major key, the 2nd subject is in the key of C minor; it ends on halfclose, bar 85, and is repeated (varied), bars 86-96(1, ending with full close.
F. The Coda is founded on the Ist subject, and consists entirely of the harmony of the tonic anddominant of C minor,.-G. Bars 108-117 form a passage leading to the development.
H. The development is principally based on previous material. A new subject appears, bar 142, and
continues to bar 158('), when the Ist subject is again referred to. It ends on dominant pedal point of 6 bars.
J. T4he first part of the Ist subject re-appears with a new variation, bars 220-2281). The second part
re-appears unaltered, bars 228-256a).
K. This connecting episode resembles the original one, and begins in the same key. Bars 260-267,
however, are transposed into the key of Db major, the subdominant chord of which is used in the beginning
of the re-appearance of the 2nd subject, treated as a Neapolitan 6th in the key of F minor (tonic), in which
key the 2nd subject is reproduced.
L. The Coda is the same as that in the enunciation, but it can only be looked upon as being the Coda
of the recapitulation, not of the whole Movement; for instead of being lengthened, and forming the
concluding part of the Movement, as usual, it is followed 15y a passage, bars 300-307, leading to a repetition
of the development and recapitulation (which is unusual), after which, with barso&amp;83-, it leads to the
final Coda, " Presto."
M. The final Coda begins with a new subject in two parts, both repeated and founded upon the same
material. (The first part begins in the tonic key, the 2nd in Ah major.) Bars 335 to the end are founded
on the Ist subject.
