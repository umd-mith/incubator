FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins with a sentence of 4 bars upon tonic pedal point. Bar 5 is repeated an 8th
lower (bar 6), bar 7 an 8th higher (bar 8), and bars 9-o1 an 8th lower (bars 11-12). The end of the Ist subject
and the commencement of the connecting episode overlap.
B. The connecting episode commences with the first 2 bars of the Ist subject. It modulates to F#
major (dominant of 2nd subject) in which key it ends, bar 22.
C. The two 4-bar phrases with which the 2nd subject commences, 22-26 and 26-30 (the 2nd being an
imitation of the Ist a note lower), are repeated with slight alterations in the bass, bars 30-38. The 4-bar
phrase, 38-42, ending in dominant key is repeated, bars 42-46. A hew figure is then introduced, bar 46.
The 2nd subject closes, bar 57, in the dominant key; (Notte the consecutive 5ths, bar 53.)
D. The bass of the Coda is formed upon the Ist subject. It modulates from the dominant key back to
the tonic.
E. The development begins with a reminiscence of the Ist subject, but after a few bars an important
episode is introduced, bars 66-82, in the key of C major. Bars 82-92 are formed on the Ist subject, upon
dominant pedal point.
F. The connecting episode is of the same length as the original one, the first 4 bars of which are varied
and the keys altered so as to end in dominant key.
G. The 2nd subject is transposed into the tonic key. (Note the consecutive 5ths, bar 145.)
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. " Menuetto and Trio," though not so designated.
B. The " Allegretto " (Menuetto) is in Aria form.
C. The Coda consists of a figure, bars 52-53, taken from the Ist subject (bars 12-13), which is repeated
5 times on a tonic pedal point.
D. The ist part of the " Maggiore " (Trio) ends in the dominant key, but as only the principal subject
is repeated this movement resembles Aria form more nearly than any other.
E. This episode is formed upon a pedal point on G (the dominant).
F. The 2nd movement ends at bar 34, followed by 4 bars, (34-38) modulating back to the key of tonic
(E minor). Bars 27-38 occur again in the Coda.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins with section of 4 bars ending on dominant 7th followed by 2 sections (the
2nd being an exact transposition of the former an eighth lower) of 2 bars each, forming a complete sentence
in E. The Ist subject ends bar 9. Bars 1o-i6 consist of a repetition of the Ist subject (shortened).
B. This episode is principally based upon a figure borrowed from the Ist subject, bar 5. It is entirely
in the key of the dominant.
C. The 2nd subject, bars 23(8)-272), is repeated (slightly varied), bars 27-32. It consists of a 4-bar
sentence in B major.
D. This episode begins with a reminiscence of Ist subject in E minor, and modulates to G major, on the
dominant (pedal point) of which key the figure employed in the Ist episode (letter B) occurs.
E. The 3rd subject is derived from the triplet accompaniment to the Ist subject.
F. This episode resembles the Ist episode transposed into the key of A.
G. Instead of being in tonic key the 2nd subject re-appears in A major.
H. These bars constitute a passage formed upon the 2nd subject leading back to the tonic key.
J. The varied appearance of the Ist subject has all the elements of a Coda. The figure upon which the
episodes are formed already referred to (letter B), re-appears at the end of the movement, bars 127, I28.
