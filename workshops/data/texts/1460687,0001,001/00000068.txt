B. The second part commences with a passage beginning in BI minor, ending in Db major,
bars 47-55, which is repeated with the parts inverted, bars 558)-63m. The same passage then appears, bars
648-72"), beginning in Db major, ending in Bf minor (the keys being reversed). It occurs again,
bars 72z()-8o(0, with the parts reversed. After 2 bars in Bb minor, 80-81, the time changes to Presto, and a
new subject is introduced, bars 82-89, beginning in Bb minor, and ending in F major, repeated (varied),
bars 90-97"~, beginning in F major and ending in Bb minor.
C. Bars 98-115 form a passage, the commencement of which is founded on " Presto," leading to the
repetition of part I.
D. Part I is repeated in its entirety.
E. The Coda commences with a modulation to B minor by enharmonic change, Bh-A#. It closes with
a reference to the commencement of part I.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject is preceded by an introductory bar (I). At bars 14-15 there is a curious modulation
to G major; bars 10-17 are repeated (varied and extended), bars 18-26.
B. The connecting episode commences, after one bar of introduction, with a new syncopated subject
of 3 bars (28-31"), repeated (varied), bars 31-34"). Bar 34 is repeated (varied), 35, after which follows a
passage modulating to D major, bars 36-45"'.
C. The 2nd subject leads off with a phrase, the melody of which is in the bass, bars 45-46 (the
notes forming it simply consisting of the triad of D major), repeated in the treble, bars 47-48. The same
phrase (varied) then occurs in the bass, with semiquaver triplet accompaniment, bars 49-50, and is repeated
again in the treble, with the same accompaniment, bars 51-52, followed by an ascending passage in the treble
(bars 53('-56) of 4 bars (accompanied by semiquaver figure), the bass being 2 octaves and a 3rd below it until
bar 56, where it is a Ioth below. The 2nd subject ultimately ends with full close in D major, bars 62(5)-63().
D. The Coda simply confirms the final cadence of the 2nd subject; it ends on the chord of the 6th,
bar 69().
E. The development begins in D major with a varied repetition of the first 3 bars of the Ist subject
(bars 69-71), which is repeated in the bass in F# minor, bars 73-75. The first bar of the Ist subject occurs
at bar 77 in Eh major, after which the whole of the development is based upon the outline of the first 4
notes of the Ist subject, which form a triad, beginning, bar 78, with Cl, Ah, F, and followed by Db, Bh, GD#, Bt, G#-E, C#, A2, &amp;c., ending with a cadenza upon dominant 9th of the tonic (bar 87).
F. The Ist subject re-appears considerably varied throughout.
G. The connecting episode begins in D major, and, though it resembles that in the enunciation, it is
considerably altered so as to end in the tonic major key. The original connecting episode commenced in
F# minor (tonic), and finished in D major; this one begins in D major and ends in F* major.
H. The 2nd subject appears, varied, and transposed into tonic major key.
J. The Coda commences as in the enunciation (the key being changed from D to F* major), and
refers to both the Ist and 2nd subjects. The key signature changes to I sharp, bar 156; 2 sharps, bar
164; and to 3 sharps, bar 166. From this bar to the end, the Coda is based upon the Ist subject in tonic
key. It ends, however, with the major tonic chord.
