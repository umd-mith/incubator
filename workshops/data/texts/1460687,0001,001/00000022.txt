In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins with a 4-bar phrase ending on dominant, bar 5, followed by a 6-bar phrase
which ends with full close in tonic key.
B. The connecting episode begins with a continuation of the Ist subject. At bar 23 there occurs a fresh
theme in B minor; which is, however, only introductory to the 2nd subject. The episode ends on dominant
chord, which is unusual (see Ist Movement, No. 3).
