FIRST MOVEMENT.

A. The first ten bars of the Ist subject are repeated an 8th higher, ir-2o. The next 8 bars, 21-28,
are treated in the same way (with slight alterations and elongations), bars 29-39. This subject ends with
a full close on tonic.
B. The connecting episode is of great importance; it contains three distinct episodes, bars 40-62,
63-77', and 77-90(.
C. The 2nd subject begins simultaneously with the ending of the last phrase of the connecting episode.
D. The 2nd subject is divided into 2 parts, bars 90('-I135() and I35(')-59; both begin and end in
the dominant key.
E. Bars 159-162 form a passage leading to the development.
F. The development is almost entirely founded upon.bars 7-10 of the Ist subject.   Double
counterpoint at the 8th is continuously used from bar 184 to 208. There is no reference to the 2nd
subject, excepting at the end, where a portion of the 2nd part of the 2nd subject appears (varied) in
B major, B minor, and D major. The development ends on dominant 7th, bar 269.
G. The connecting episode begins exactly like the original one, bars 313-337. It ends, however, in
the key of A (instead of E). The 2nd part, bars 338-352, and the 3rd part, bars 352-365, are an exact copy
of the 2nd and 3rd parts of the original connecting episode transposed a 4th higher, so as to end in D
instead of A.
H. Bars 435-438 form a passage leading into Coda.
J. The Coda, formed on tonic pedal point, refers to the Ist subject.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins with section of 4 bars, ending in D minor, followed by another 4-bar
section, beginning in F major, and ending in A minor.
B. This episode is formed upon dominant pedal point.
C. The Ist subject is altered so as to end in tonic key.
D. The Ist subject is altered so as to end in D major.
E. The Coda refers to both subjects.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject in the key of D major, bars 1-8, is repeated slightly altered, bars 9-16, in
the key of the dominant; bars 1-16 are then repeated with slight alterations, bars 17-32.
B. This episode is in sequence. The first 4 bars, 33-36, are repeated first of all in A major, bars
37-40, then in B minor, bars 41-44; it closes on dominant 7th, bar 48.
C. The Ist subject is slightly altered and elongated; it closes in D major.
D. The Ist subject in the 2nd part is in two sections of 4 bars each, repeated, bars 9-24, with the 2nd
section preceding the Ist section, occurring in this form twice.
FOURTH MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject is curiously constructed. The first 4 bars are repeated, 5-9; the next 4 bars,
9(6-13, are treated in the same way (varied), bars I3()-17. The whole of the subject is written upon
a tonic pedal point.
B. This episode, formed of arpeggios, begins in D major and ends in E major.
C. The 2nd subject consists of 4 bars, 29(6)-33, repeated (varied), bars 33(6)-37, the rest of the subject
being made up of a repetition of bars 366)-37(6. The first bar of the subject leads off in the treble,
answered at the 8th below by the alto, and then by the bass.
D. Bars 44-52 form a passage leading to 2nd entry of Ist subject.
E. At bars 57-58 a little figure is added in the treble part (where there were rests originally).
F. The Ist part of the 3rd subject, bars 68-l-79, might be looked upon as a development of the Ist
subject; at bar 80, however, the subject assumes an independence of its own.
G. Bars 102-114 form a passage on dominant pedal point leading to 3rd entry of Ist subject.
H. The figure referred to at letter E is slightly elaborated, bars II9-I20.
J. This episode resembles the original one, altered so as to end in A, instead of in E major.
K. Bars 161-169 form a passage leading to Coda.
L. The Coda begins with an allusion to the 3rd subject. At bar 194 the time changes to Piu Allegro,
the bass being the same as that which accompanies the Ist subject.
