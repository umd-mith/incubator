FIRST MOVEMENT.

A. The Ist subject, consisting of a sentence of 8 bars, begins and ends in the tonic key, and is
constructed upon tonic pedal point.
B. The connecting episode begins with a modulation to the dominant, after some arpeggios in that key
it modulates to A major. The end of it overlaps the entry of the 2nd subject.
C. The second subject commences with a 4-bar phrase, 24-27, repeated, bars 28-31, the first 2 bars of
which are in the key of A major. At bars 32-33 the bass of bars 28-29 is transferred from the bass to the
treble. The subject ends with full close in the key of the dominant, bars 45-461".
D. Bars 46-49 form a passage, leading, in the first instance, to the repetition of the enunciation, and
afterwards, with the addition of bars 51-52 (omitting bar 50), to the development.
E. The development refers principally to the Ist subject and the episode. It commences with the
former in the key of E major. The first part of the latter appears at bar 100 in the key of Eb major.
F. The connecting episode is of the same length, and is composed of the same material as the original
one, but altered so as to end in D major.
G. Bars 169-174 form a passage leading, in the first instance, to the repetition of the development and
recapitulation, afterwards, with bars 175-176 (omitting bars 171-174), leading to Coda.
H. The Coda is formed of reminiscences of the Ist subject, the first 4 bars of which are heard twice in
the bass, repeated in the treble a note higher. The form of this movement closely resembles that of the last
movement of No. 23, Op. 57.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject, consisting of a sentence of 8 bars, begins and ends in G minor (tonic key), modulating,
with full close, to relative major, bar 4.
B. Bar 9 modulates to the key of Eh major.
C. The 2nd subject, which does not modulate, begins and ends in the key of EP major.
D. Bars 17-22"' form a passage leading back to the tonic key.
E. The Coda is derived from the Ist subject.

second part, bars 9-16, beginning in dominant and ending in tonic key. Both parts are repeated.
B. This episode consists of an 8-bar sentence, 17()-25), in E minor, followed by several bars formed upon
the Ist subject, modulating back to tonic key.
C. The Ist subject re-appears with a varied accompaniment; the repetition is omitted.
D. This episode commences with a 4-bar phrase, 5I(2)-55), repeated a fourth higher, 55")-59(). Bars
59("-67() are a varied repetition of bars 5I(1'-59(2

repeated with considerable variation, bars 81-88.
G. The Coda is entirely formed upon the Ist subject.
