resumption of the Ist subject, harmonised, which, after a passage in contrary motion, ends with full close
in tonic key.
C. The connecting episode consists of a fugal development of a varied version of the Ist subject, closing
at bar 34 in EK.
D. The 2nd subject, instead of being in EP major, is in Ah major, bars 34('-36(2, it is repeated (varied),
bars 36('-382), it ends upon the first inversion of the chord of Ah major, bar 39(2)
E. The Coda, after 2 introductory bars, 39"4)-4I, begins with a 4-bar phrase in Ah major, bars 42-45, the
bass of which is derived from the Ist subject, and is repeated in the treble with slight alterations,
bars 45(8)-49(). A chromatic passage brings the enunciation to an end in Ai major, bar 53.
F. Bars 55-56 lead to the development.
G. The development refers principally to the Ist subject. Bars 61-67 consist of a fugal treatment of
the Ist subject, which is augmented in one part and in the original time in another. A dominant pedal
point (bars 71-75) prepares the ear for the entry of the Ist subject (bar 77).
H. The Ist subject re-appears in double octaves, the second bar (78) is repeated twice (instead of once
as before) (bar 79-80), and forms the basis of the next few bars, which resemble bars 16-17, but the
full close in the tonic is interrupted, and the passage ends in F minor, bar 85a).
J. The connecting episode is slightly altered and transposed so as to begin in F minor and end on G.
K. The 2nd subject re-appears in the tonic major key, and at bar 107 a prolongation of it begins. The
principal phrase occurs in F minor in the bass, bars o19-11o (it is strikingly similar to the beginning of the
2nd subject in the last movement of the so-called " Moonlight " Sonata). A development of the 2nd subject
continues till bar 117.
L. The Coda, after 3 introductory bars, 117-119, begins with the same material as in the enunciation,
transposed into C minor (tonic key); after bar 131, however, it is extended by 4 bars referring to the
Ist subject, 131-134, and by a phrase occurring (varied) three times, ending in the tonic major key.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The " Air " is divided into two sections, both repeated. The first section, bars 1-9, commences with
a 4-bar phrase, and ends with half-close on dominant, followed by another 4-bar phrase ending in tonic key.
The second section, bars 11-18, is also composed of two 4-bar phrases. The first, bars 11-14"), in A minor,
ending with half-close on the dominant of that key; the second phrase, bars 14"'-18, being in the tonic key.
There is no break of any kind between the air and the first variation, or between the variations themselves.
B. The first variation is characterised by a triplet figure in the bass, the melody being written in the
same rhythm as the first two notes of the air.
C. In the second variation the time is changed to 16.
D. The third variation is in 1  time, sweeping arpeggios against syncopated chords form the
principal feature of this variation.
E. The fourth variation is in,6 time. A great deal of it is constructed upon a pedal point in the
bass, see bars 78-85, 95-98, and 99-102. The repetitions of both sections, written out in full, bars 86-94
and bars o13-11o, are characterised by the very florid part for the right hand. This variation is followed
by a Coda commencing, bar iiI, upon tonic pedal point. At bar 120 the perfect cadence is interrupted by
the supertonic D being prolonged by a shake, together with references to the "Air." This note (D) at bar 124
is made the leading note to E0  major, the chord of the 6th on Bt being followed by the dominant 7th on BP.
This chord continues till bar 128, where the 7th, Ah, begins to rise chromatically to D, the leading note,
bar 130, and resolves into Eh major, bar 132, introducing a phrase of the "Air" (varied) from bars 6, 7, 8, at
bars 132, 133, 134. The latter bar is then treated in sequence, bars 134-139, followed by another sequence
closing in AP major, bars 139-143, succeeded at bar 144 by-a diminished seventh on F#, resolving on
the dominant of C major preparatory to the entiy of variation 5 in that key.
F. In variation 5 the melody of the air is very prominently given in the treble part against a florid bass.
The two sections are not repeated in this variation. At bar 161i'n there begins a Coda formed upon the last
3 notes of the air, the final cadence of which resolves into variation 6, bar 176.
G. Variation 6 is constructed entirely upon an inverted dominant pedal point. The air is easily
distinguishable; the first phrase in the inner part, bars 176-180); the second phrase in the upper part,
bars I8o'80-I84, accompanied by a tremolo bass. At bar 185 a prolongation of the variation commences upon
tonic pedal point, which gives place to a passage in imitation, bar 187. Three bars suggestive of the
beginning of the "Air " bring this Sonata to a close.
