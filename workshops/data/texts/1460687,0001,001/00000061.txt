FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. This is the only Piano Sonata to which Beethoven has affixed a title to indicate its contents.
B. The introduction forms the foundation of a great deal of the succeeding movement, the first three
notes (" Lebe-wohl ") especially being used in various forms in the Ist subject and connecting episode, at
the commencement of the 2nd subject, in the development, and in the Coda. The first six bars are
repeated, bars 7-12, slightly altered and transposed.
C. The Ist subject commences upon the subdominant chord, which is followed by a sequence, bars
[1"-2 formed upon the " Lebe-wohl " phrase. The figure of the variation of it is evidently taken from bars
2(4)-3(1) of introduction.  The "Lebe-wohl" phrase occurs in the bass with the first note dotted, bars
3-4). These first 4 bars at first sight seem to be a continuation of the introduction, but they evidently
form part of the ist subject, which is in two sections, bars I-5( and 5(8)-9().
D. The connecting episode begins with a repetition of the 2nd section of the Ist subject followed by
some passages in contrary motion. The "Lebe-wohl" phrase then appears, bars 19-22, in the bass and
(inverted) in the treble, in the same form as in the bass of bars 3-4(1; it also occurs in the treble, bars
30o4)-32(, the first note being prolonged. The episode ends with full close in the key of the dominant.
E. The 2nd subject is in two parts, bars 34-42(') and bars 42-49. The first part begins with the " Lebewohl " phrase augmented (quadrupled). Bars 34-37 are repeated, bars 38-41 an octave lower, bars 42-43 are
repeated, bars 44-45 an octave higher.  Bars 46-49 are based upon the " Lebe-wohl" phrase treated in
various ways (by diminution in the treble, bar 46).
F. Bars 49-55 form a passage suggestive of the " Lebe-wohl " phrase, bars 49-53, leading to the repetition
of the enunciation, bars 49('-51 and 54-55, leading to the development.
G. The development commences with a reference to the beginning of the Ist subject, which, with the
" Lebe-wohl " phrase, forms the chief material on which it is based.
H. The Ist subject re-appears unaltered.
J. The connecting episode is of nearly the same length and character as before (bar 15 being
omitted), it is altered to end in tonic key.
K. The Coda, with the exception of bars 148-166, which contain a reference to the Ist subject, is
entirely based upon the " Lebe-wohl " phrase, which appears in different forms that are easily traceable.
In single notes, bars 167-176; in thirds, bars 177-xI81, accompanied by a passage in semiquavers, first beneath'
and afterwards above it, bars 183-208; in canon at the octave below, bars 209-224, diminished, bars 221-224;
and lastly at bar 229 on inverted pedal point.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. This movement, though following the outlines of Sonata form, is very irregular. v
B. The Ist subject, instead of being in the tonic key, begins with two bars in G mino oliowed by two
bars in G knajor, the same four bars are then repeated in C minor (tonic).
C. YTEcTnecting episode commences in the key of Ab major, modulating to F minor, bars 9-10. A
reference to the Ist subject in G minor is succeeded by a scale passage leading to the 2nd subject.
D. The second subject, instead of being in the relative major, is in the key of the dominant major.
E. Bars 19-20 lead to the re-entry of the Ist subject.
F. There is no development in this movement.
G. The Ist subject re-appears in F minor instead of tonic key.
H. The connecting episode is similar to the original one, altered so as to lead to the key of F major.
J. The 2nd subject, instead of being in the tonic key, re-appears here in F major.
K. Bars 35-42 form a passage leading to the next movement, there being no break between the 2nd and
3rd movements.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. This introduction is entirely formed of arpeggios on dominant harmony.
B. The Ist subject is divided into three sections overlapping each other, and each beginning and
ending in tonic key. The first, bars 11-17, with subject in the treble; the 2nd, bars 17-23, with subject in
the bass accompanied by a new figure in the treble; the third, bars 23-29m', with the subject still in the
bass, but with a different accompaniment in the treble.
C. The connecting episode begins with florid passages upon tonic pedal point (bars 29-36).  At bars
36-37 there is a modulation to the dominant. Bars 37-40 constitute a 4-bar phrase in G' major, repeated,
bars 41-44, in F major; bars 37-44 being repeated, bars 45-52, with additions and variations. The bars 37-40
and 45-48 in Gh major are evidently formed upon the chord of the Neapolitan 6th in the key of F, the
dominant of the key of the second subject.
