In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets indicate the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject, with the exception of a modulation to the dominant, bars 17-21, is entirely in the
tonic key, ending with full close, bar 33.
B. The connecting episode begins in tonic key with a passage of 2 bars in the bass, which is immediately repeated (a twelfth higher) in ihe treble. The same passage then occurs in the bass (a third higher
than it originally did), and is followed by a modulation through the dominant major key to that of the
dominant minor, in which key the connecting episode ends, bar 59.
