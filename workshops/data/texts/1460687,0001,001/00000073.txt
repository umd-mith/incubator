H. The 2nd subject re-appears, scarcely altered except harmonically, the key, of course, being changed
to Ah major.
J. The Coda resembles that in the enunciation at the beginning. After a passage of 4 bars, 1002-104,
of a different character, the connecting episode is again referred to; it closes with tonic pedal point.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. This movement may be looked upon as a Scherzo and Trio, though not so designated.
B. The Ist part (Scherzo) contains traces of Sonata form. The Ist subject consists of 2 phrases of 4
bars each, 1-8, both ending in dominant major key. What might be called the development, bars 9-29,
begins with a sequential passage of 8 bars (9-16), closing in Ah (relative major), the rhythm being formed
by inverting that of bars 5-6. A new figure appears in the relative major, bars 17-21, evidently taken from
bars 3-4. A reference to the Ist phrase, bars 21(2'-25'(,, the accent being altered, is followed by the figure at
bar 17-18 in the tonic key, leading to the re-appearance of the Ist subject in tonic key, with different accent,
as in the development, bar 21". It is altered so as to end in tonic key.
C. The 2nd part (Trio) is constructed upon a phrase of eight bars, 4(2)'-50o), ending in tonic key (Db major).
It is repeated with slight alterations, bars 50('-58(, ending in Gh major, in which key it appears, bars
58(2)-66(m, repeated, bar 66(2)-74), slightly altered, ending in EP minor. Three bars, 74(2)-77, lead back to the
tonic key (Dt major), followed immediately by the initial phrase, bars 77(2)-85(), repeated an octave lower,
bars 85(2)93. Bars 94-97 lead to the repetition of part I.
D. The Coda simply consists of a few chords in the tonic key (F minor) ending on major tonic chord.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. The introduction commences in Bb minor with a passage of 3 bars, modulating to a cadenza in
Ab minor, and immediately after by enharmonic change to another cadenza in E major, which is followed
by a modulation to Ah minor, bar 6, the key of the succeeding movement.
B. Although this movement (which commences at bar 7(')) is in Ah minor (7 flats), the signature bears
only 6 flats. This movement, preceded by the reiteration of the tonic chord, bars 7(8-8, consists of a
continuous melody, composed of 4 phrases of 4 bars each. The first phrase, bars 9-12, commences in
tonic key, and ends with half-close on the dominant, bar 12(). The 2nd phrase, bars 13-16", commences
in tonic key and ends in the relative major (Ch major). The 3rd phrase, bars 16(-20o, begins in C major,
and ends with half-close on the dominant of Ah minor. The 4th phrase, bars 204)-24(), begins and ends in
Ab minor, it is followed by a Coda of 2 bars.
FOURTH MOVEMENT.
A. See also Finale, Sonata No. 29.
B. The portion of this movement, which takes the place of the Ist subject, consists of'a fugue in 3
parts, the subject of which is announced in the bass, it begins and ends in the tonic key, bars 14)-5). It
is regularly answered in the 5th above, bars 5(4'-9(l) (counter-subject in quavers). After a short
codetta the subject enters in the treble, bars 11-15, followed by a short sequential episode formed upon
the last 4 notes of the subject, ending in the dominant key, bar 205). The answer appears again, bars
20oW-241, the subject, bars 284)-32). An episode formed upon the counter-subject leads to the entry of the
answer, bars 374)-4I), followed by an episode, resembling that beginning bar 15), modulating to C minor,
in which key a reference to the subject appears in the bass, commencing at bar 48. An episode upon a new
subject begins at bar 56(). The subject enters in DL major, bars 62(-66m, answered, bars 664)-70o). The
subject next appears, bar 76'-8o(), partly answered (in stretto), bar 78", and at bar 8o(0). The fugue ends
upon dominant 7th, bar 89.
C. This episode, with its short introduction (bars 89(')-9o), resembles the 3rd movement, transposed a
semitone lower into G minor. It is considerably altered, however, and shortened. It ends in G minor,
bar o16. The Coda in G major resembles that at the end of 3rd movement (extended).
D. The fugue subject re-appears here, in G major (inverted), bars IIIm-115m, answered, bars 115i-119i.
Development of it in this form continues till bar 127().
E. There is nothing in this movement which takes the place of the 2nd part usually found in Rondo
form, unless the episode which begins bar 127 can be looked upon as such. It is formed upon a new
subject, bars 127-I28(2), in the bass, which is none other than the original subject in diminution. It is
treated almost canonically, and with it is combined the subject (augmented), bars I27C(6-I35, also at bars
I35'-i43", ending in dominant key. The figure of the foregoing episode gives place to another variation
of the original subject, bar 143, which is developed till bar 149. The inverted form of the subject appears
at bars I45-I49%.
F. The subject re-appears, bars I49'(4-I53(m, in its original form and key, in octaves, with a new
accompaniment, answered, bars I53C-157. A final entry of the subject, bars I59'4-I63a, followed by a
development of the last 4 notes, brings this part of the movement to a close in tonic key, bar 175c.
G. The Coda principally refers to the Ist subject upon tonic pedal point.
