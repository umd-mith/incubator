In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins with a 4-bar phrase ending in tonic key, bars 1-5"', followed by another phrase
of the same length, ending in the key of B major, bars 5("-9"). After this it appears as if another phrase
was about to commence, but it gets no further than half a bar's length, bar 9(8), before it is interrupted by
an episode.
B. This episode, which begins with a discord (inversion of dominant minor 9th), is after the first
2 bars in the form of a cadenza, it commences in the key of C# minor and ends in B major.
C. The ist subject is only represented rhythmically and by development (the treble, bars I-22)", is in the
bass in a different key (B major), bars I7-I8('). At bar 23(8) a new melody is introduced upon the Ist subjectfigure commencing in G# minor. An inverted dominant pedal point, bar 44-50o), leads to a repetition of the
rst subject in a modified form upon a scale passage in the bass, altered so as to end in tonic key.
The perfect cadence, however, is interrupted (as at bar 9-1o) by an episode (bar 60).
