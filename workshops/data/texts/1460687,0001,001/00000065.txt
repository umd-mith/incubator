G. The original connecting episode is altered at the commencement, bars 59"'-60, but bars 60o"-6811 are
the same as bars 8(61-166, slightly varied, and transposed into tonic key.
H. The 2nd subject (transposed into tonic key) is slightly altered at bars 76-80.
J. The Coda commences as in the enunciation (transposed into tonic key), but it is elongated at bar
85. At bars 98()-99() there is a reference to the 2nd subject, which is inverted, bars 99(gg)-loo
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. This movement evidently takes the place of the Scherzo.
B. The first part is in modified Sonata form.- The bass of bars 1-8 proceeds chromatically
(though not in the same octave) from F down to F$ (with the exception of B4).
C. There is no 2nd subject, but the Ist subject'(which is repeated) modulates to and ends in the
dominant.
D. Bar 9 is repeated at bar II (an octave higher) and at bar 12-13 in the key of F (tonic).
E. The development commences with a figure from bars 2-3 used in imitation. At bars 17-19 a new
figure is introduced, imitated in the bass, bars 18-20. The rest of the development consists of references to
the Ist subject; it ends with bars 5-7 (varied) upon dominant pedal, bars 38-41.
F. Instead of the re-appearance of the Ist subject, bar 42, there is a vigorous passage of imitation
founded upon bar 5. After several passages in contrary motion, the end of the first subject, which originally
appeared in the dominant key, occurs transposed into tonic key, bars 54-56.
G. The znd part is in modified Sonata form.
H. Bars 58-60 form an introduction to the 2nd part.
J. The Ist subject only consists of 2 bars, 61-62. Bar 63 being an inversion of bar 62.
K. The 2nd subject is in canon at the octave below, it begins and ends in dominant key.
L. The development, which overlaps the 2nd subject, is also in canon at the octave throughout,
leading off with a subject taken from the bass of bars 62-63, which gives place to a new figure at bar 74.
M. The Ist subject re-appears, accompanied by pedal point in the treble.
N. The antecedent of the canon constituting the 2nd subject re-appears here in the bass instead of in
the treble as originally.
O. Bars 88-98 form a passage which leads to the repetition of part I. Bars 88-94 are founded upon the
rhythm of bars 59-60. Bars 95-98 are almost an exact repetition of 38-41.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. This Adagio may be looked upon as a distinct slow movement, but it is evidently an introduction
to the finale, being fragmentary in character.  It begins with dominant harmony and is for the most part
constructed upon the figure in the treble of bar I. It ends at bar 20 with a cadenza upon dominant chord.
B. The Ist subject of the Ist movement re-appears in its original key, the 2 phrases of which it is
composed being separated by a pause; the last three notes of bar 4 are repeated at different intervals, bars
5-7. At bar 8 the time changes to Presto.
C. Bars 1-4 upon dominant harmony lead to the Ist subject of the finale.
D. The Ist subject is of considerable length, and may be divided into 2 parts. The first part, bars
4(4)-2o(8): the whole movement is constructed mainly upon the initial figure. The first 8 bars, 4(4)-I2(8), are
repeated (inverted and altered to end in tonic key), bars I2"-20o". The 2nd part, bars 20(-290a, begins with
a new figure in the treble, bars 20'4)-22(~', repeated in an inner part, bars 22(('-24'), the remaining bars of the
2nd part, 24(4)-29), are constructed on bars 2o(4)-2I(", and lead to the resumption of the Ist part (inverted), the
conclusion of which is treated canonically at the octave. The Ist subject ends with full close, bar 37(1).
E. The connecting episode is in 2 distinct parts, the semiquaver figure of the Ist part, bars 37-52"), is
taken from bar 5. The first part begins in tonic key and modulates to E major, upon the dominant
7th of which key it ends, bar 52~'). The 2nd part consists of two phrases quite distinct from  the
preceding material; the Ist phrase of 6 bars' length, 53M)-59(), and the 2nd phrase consisting of 4 bars,
59(8-628, in the key of E major.
F. The 2nd subject is clearly taken from the beginning of the Ist subject, it is imitated by an inner
part at the 5th. The figure in the bass of bars 70-71 is also so treated in the treble, bars 72-73. The 2nd
subject ends with a passage of the nature of a codetta, bars 75-85.
G. Bars 86"(-95 form a passage leading to the development.
H. The development is in fugue form, which is unusual. The subject of it (which is taken from the
Ist subject) begins in A minor, bars 96'-Ioom, followed by a codetta beginning an octave above the subject,
bars Ioo~2-Io3. The answer, instead of being in E minor, appears in the relative major, bars Io3([)-Io7(),
accompanied by a counter-subject, which causes it to end in F major. This is followed by the codetta (referred
to above), beginning a 7th above the last note of the answer. The subject then re-appears, bars IIno[-II4',
in D minor, instead of in tonic key, with the codetta imitated by an inner part at the under 9th. The subject
occurs again at bars II8'-Iz22 in original key; at bars I28('-i3I(8 in relative major, each time followed by
the codetta. Note the consecutive 5ths, bar 125. An episode formed upon a fragment of the codetta, bars
