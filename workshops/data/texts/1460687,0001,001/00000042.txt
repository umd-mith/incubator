In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins and ends upon dominant harmony; the first 2 bars, "Largo," play an
important part in the course of the movement.
B. The connecting episode begins with a continuation of the Ist subject, ending on full close in the
tonic key, bars 7-21, after which is introduced a regular theme in D minor; the first four notes of
which are based upon the figure represented by bars 1-2, they are repeated in the bass, on notes rising by
conjunct degrees from D to E, the dominant of the key of the 2nd subject. (See also Connecting Episode,
Op. 14, No. 2, Ist Movement.)
