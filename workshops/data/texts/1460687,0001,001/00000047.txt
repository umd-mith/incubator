A. The Ist subject consists of a section of 8 bars, ending with half-close upon the dominant.
B. The connecting episode begins with the first 4 bars of the Ist subject, after which it modulates into
the key of F major, dominant of the relative major.
C. The 2nd subject begins with 2-bar phrase, 17-18, repeated, 8th higher, 19-20, and again at bars

extended), bars 26-30.

F; The connecting episode resembles the original one, altered so as to end in dominant key instead
of in the key of F.
