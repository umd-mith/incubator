In numbering the bars, each portion of a bar, either at the commencement or in the course of a movement,
has been reckoned as one bar; the small figures in brackets denote the beat of the bar to which
reference is made.
FIRST   MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject begins in the tonic key with a section of 4 bars, ending in G major, which is repeated
a tone lower (bars 5-8), with the exception of the note AP in bar 8, which is a tone and a half lower. This is
followed by a 4-bar section in C minor and a pause on the dominant. In the space of 13 bars the Ist subject
modulates to G major, F major, F minor, and C minor; it ends on half-close upon the dominant, bar 13.
B. The connecting episode begins (bars 14-17) with the Ist section of the Ist subject, which is repeated
(bars 18-21) in D and A minor; bar 22is a repetition of bar 21 with the 6th of the chord raised a semitone,
forming an augmented 6th in the key of E minor, upon the dominant (pedal point) of which there follows a
brilliant passage in E minor, leading into E major.
C. The 2nd subject may be divided into three parts. The Ist part (bars 35-42) is repeated (varied),
bars 43-50. Bars 50-74 constitute the 2nd part, and bars 74-77 the 3rd part (repeated, bars 78-82(1, an 8th
lower). The ist and 2nd parts are in E major (instead of being in the dominant key), the 3rd part beginning
in A minor and ending in E minor.
