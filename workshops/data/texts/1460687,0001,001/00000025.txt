D. The 2nd subject begins in Eh minor instead of in El major. It is divided into 3 parts, Ist part, bars
41-79 (beginning in El minor); 2nd part, bars 79-103 (in Eh major); 3rd part, bars 103-11I (in El major).
E. The Coda contains a portion of the Ist subject in Eh major, it ends on the Ist inversion of the
dominant 7th of G minor, bar 124.
F. The development commences in G minor with the first 2 bars of the introduction, the 2nd of which
is repeated, bar 127, and at the end of it there is an enharmonic modulation (Eh-D#) into E minor. The
introduction is again referred to, bars 132-133 and 138-139, the figure used being undoubtedly taken from it.
The development, however, has reference principally to the Ist subject.
G. The connecting episode begins with a repetition of the first 4 bars of the Ist subject, and is formed
principally upon bars 5-6 of the same subject. Excepting at the commencement and at the close, it quite
differs from the original connecting episode.
H. The first part of the 2nd subject (instead of being in C minor) re-appears first in F minor, bars
213-229. At bar 229 it, as well as the other parts, occurs in the tonic key.
J. The Coda commences with a portion of the Ist subject, followed by 4 bars " Grave," derived from
the introduction, ending with a final reference to the Ist subject.
SECOND MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject of 8 bars ending on full close in the tonic is repeated (varied) an 8th higher, bars 9-16,
B. This episode begins, bar 16, in F minor, but at bar 20 it modulates to E), the dominant.
C. The Ist subject re-appears without the varied repetition (see note A).
D. This episode commences in Al minor. In it are two instances of enharmonic modulation: at bar
42, where it modulates to E major, in which key the first part is repeated, and at bar 48 (the modulation
here being from the key of E major into the chord of the dominant minor 9th of El). This chord is followed
by dominant harmony (chords of the IIth and dominant 7th) leading into the third appearance of the Ist
subject in tonic key. At the commencement of this episode the rhythm of the harmony of the accompaniment is changed into triplets, and continues so to the end of the movement.
E. The ist subject is repeated an 8th higher (as at the commencement), bar 59.
THIRD MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject ends bar 9, bars 1o-18 being only a continuation of it.
B. This episode is in sequential form. A phrase in F minor, bars 19-22, being repeated (with slight
alterations) in Eh major, bars 23-26.
C. The 2nd subject may be divided into 2 parts, bars 26-44 and 44-52, both beginning and ending in Er.
D. After the 2nd subject there is a passage leading back to tonic key ending on dominant 7th, it is
constructed mainly upon a part of the 2nd subject (bars 34(3)-35a)).
E. The 3rd subject, bars 79-87, is varied, bars.88-95. After 4 bars of imitation it appears again (varied),
bars Ioo-I9,8.
F. After the 2nd variation of the 3rd subject ending on the dominant, bar io8, there is a passage of 14
bars on dominant pedal point preparatory to the second entry of the Ist subject.
G. The Ist subject re-appears without the " continuation " referred to at "A."
H. This episode is built upon the 6th and 7th bars of the Ist subject. It is sequential in form, bars
130-131 in C minor are repeated, bars 132-133. It then modulates, by the aid of the augmented 6th, to the
key of C major, in which key the 2nd subject immediately begins.
J. The second portion of the 2nd subject referred to in note C (bars 44-52) is altered and prolonged,
bars 154-171, and the passage which followed the 2nd subject in part I is omitted.
K.'The " continuation" of the Ist subject (see note A) is varied and curtailed.
L. The'Coda begins with a passage, bars 183-187, founded upon a part of the 2nd subject (bar 34)
varied and lengthened, bars 187-194. It is followed by a passage in C minor, bars 194-203, modulating by
means of the Neapolitan 6th (bar 199) to the dominant 7th of A' major, the passage ends on pause, bar
203, and a final reference to the Ist subject in the key of Ah major (repeated); it modulates back to the tonic
key by means of the chord of the augmented 6th, bar 208. The movement closes with a descending passage
in the harmonic minor scale.
