MUSIC PRIMERS
f  EDITED BY
SIR JOHN STAINER.'
IN issuing this series of Music Primers the Editor sees with pleasure the realisation of desire he
has long felt, to place in the hands of teachers and students of music a set of educational works df
a high standard at a price so low as to render them attainable' by all.
The growing'interest in music generally, and rapid spread of its stt ly, so % cry e'ident in 'this
country, render it of the utmost importance that the student's first steps in ever, ' 1-imrh slhould be
dilected with skill and based on sound principles. The Editor has kept this object steldily in
vibw, and be believes thpt each one of these Primers will prove to be au carefully consIructea in
detail as it is comprehensive ir design.
Such a result would have been impossible but for the hearty support and sympathy of those
authors, men of''known ability in their pecial branches of art, who have embodied the results of
their long arid vAluable experience in their respective contributions.
While gratefully acknowledging the kindness of these gentlemen, the Editor cannot but e- p-ers
a hope that the Primers may prove as useful to the public, and as beneficial to art, as U): a
authors and publishers have endeavoured to make them.
