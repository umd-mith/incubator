FOURTH MOVEMENT.
A. The first sentence of the Ist subject ending with full close in the tonic, bar 7, is repeated, 7-13. The
ist subject may be divided into two parts totally different in character. The first part, bars 1-7 (which is
repeated, bars 7-13), and the 2nd part, bars 13-29, both beginning and ending in tonic key.
B. The connecting episode commences with the passage, bars 21-25, transposed into tonic minor key,
succeeded by some new material in the key of the dominant, in which key it ends, bar 65.
C. The 2nd subject is constructed almost entirely upon the common chord of Bt. The rhythm of it is
borrowed from the 2nd part of the Ist subject.
D. Bars 77-80 form a passage, consisting of an extension of the chord of the dominant 7th, leading to the
repetition of the enunciation, and after that to the development.
E. The development commences with the passage (slightly altered) which precedes it, transposed into
the key of Gf. The 2nd part of the Ist subject then appears in that key; at bar 99 a new figure is introduced
in B minor (enharmonic modulation, bars 94-95, GP, Ft), repeated, bars 107-110, in C minor; at bars
111-114 in Ab major; at bars 115-118 in Dh major; the tonic chord of which is treated as a Neapolitan 6th of
the key of C, and the figure finally appears in that key, bars 119-122. The 2nd part of the Ist subject is
then again reverted to in the key of C. After some further modulations the development ends upon dominant
harmony.
F. The first subject re-appears in its original form.
G. The connecting episode commences as before, and is composed of nearly the same matter, transposed for the most part into Gb major.
H. The 2nd subject re-appears in the key of Gb major, bar 242, and in the tonic minor key, bar 254,
modulating, bar 265, to the key of the dominant.
J. The Coda commences with a prolonged variation upon the chord of the dominant 7th. From bars
284 to the end there are repeated references to the ist subject.
