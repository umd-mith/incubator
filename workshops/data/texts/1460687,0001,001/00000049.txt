FIRST MOVEMENT.
A. The Ist subject consists of 2 sections of 4 bars each, bars 1-4 and. 8"'-I2 (the bars.5-8 being a
repetition of the Ist section an 8th higher).
B. The connecting episode, which commences with a reference to the 2nd section of the Ist subject, is
in the key of the tonic, excepting for a transient modulation to the dominant, bar 15, at which bar there is
a dominant pedal point which continues until bar 20.
C. The 2nd subject is in two parts. The Ist part, which ends in the key of A major, bars 20-28, is
repeated, bars 28-36, altered at the end so as to close in D major. The 2nd part begins and ends in
the dominant key, bars 36-49 -D. The Coda is formed upon the connecting episode figure.
E. The development begins in A minor, modulates to E minor, bar 57, and ends in G major, bars 66-67.
F. The 2nd section of the Ist subject (bars 8-12) is omitted, and there is only a partial recurrence
of the repetition of the Ist section (see letter A).
G. The connecting episode is considerably altered. It commences with the Ist section of the Ist
subject (bar 71), but it modulates to C major, bars 74-75, and is extended into a 5-bar phrase. The
succeeding part of the episode (bars 75-81) is derived from the 2nd part of the 2nd subject (bars 36-49).
It ends with the closing part of the original connecting episode.
II. The 2nd subject and Coda are transposed into the tonic key.
