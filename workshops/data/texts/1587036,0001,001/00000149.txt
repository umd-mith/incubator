appear in any part which happens to be the
seat of gouty inflammation.
Persons who are subjects of gout are also
liable to gravelly complaints, and to calculus
both of the kidneys and bladder. The urine is
found not only to contain urea and the other
solids in excess, but deposits lithic acid and
lithate of soda. The nephritic complaints generally supervene after the gout has lasted some
time, and the paroxysms of the two complaints
rather alternate than coincide with each other.
In regard to the causes of gout, it is, in the
first place, an hereditary disease. A majority
of persons affected with it can trace the predisposition to their parents or ancestry. It does
not follow, however, that all the children of
gouty progenitors have the disease. It sometimes leaps over one generation and appears in
the next, and it is frequently kept off in those
who are disposed to it, by an active and abstemious life. When gout and gravel affect the
same person, it often happens that some of the
children inherit the one, and some the other
disease, alone.
Gout rarely if ever appears before puberty.
