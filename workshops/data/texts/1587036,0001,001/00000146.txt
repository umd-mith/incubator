ON GOUT.


with perhaps an unwonted degree of vigor and
alacrity.
A precursory stage in most persons takes
place in advance of the paroxysm. It is marked by a deranged state of the appetite and
digestion, by heartburn, nausea, flatulence, and
offensive alvine discharges, also by languor,
headache, low spirits and disturbed sleep.
The first paroxysm of gout is the almost certain prelude to others, which are to follow after
an interval of some months or years, according
to the predisposition and habits of life of the
patient. Some persons escape with two or
three paroxysms only during life; others have
an annual visitation, and others are attacked
once in two or three months. The frequency of
the paroxysms goes on increasing, until in some
patients there is hardly any respite, unless for a
few months in summer. The later paroxysms,
however, are often more supportable, but the
general health is more impaired than in the
earlier attacks.
In the later attacks both feet are liable to be
affected in succession, and the inflammation,
after having left one foot may return to it again.
