This takes place when the pleura is pathologically distended, so as to overcome the obtuse or
muffling effect of the contiguous soft organs,
such as the lung, diaphragm  and intercostal
muscles. Some time is probably necessary to
prepare the parts for this pathological resonance,
since it fails to appear post mortem in healthy
chests submitted to experiment. It should be
added, that when metallic sounds appear in
simple phthisis, there are cavities of the lungs,
the walls of which are in a state of tubercular
induration,
2. The, immediate or exciting cause of metallic tinkling, is a forcible or sudden disturbance
of th~e liquid in a vibrating cavity like that
described.  The explosion of bubbles of air
from beneath the surface of the liquid, appears
to be the most common cause of such a disturbance; but it may also take place when a
part of the liquid is thrown upward in the act
of coughing and falls back upon the remainder.
The same occurs in succussion of the chest.
3. The vibrations which yield metallic tinkling are transmitted from the liquid to the solid
parietes, and thence directly to the ear, without
