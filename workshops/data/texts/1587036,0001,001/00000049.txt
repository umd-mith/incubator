But I may be excused for doing this in the
presence of an audience of educated men, and
the members of a society, whose motto is Natwrd duce. The longer and the more philosophically we contemplate this subject, the more
obvious it will appear, that the physician is but
the minister and servant of nature; that in cases
like those which have been engaging our consideration, we can do little more than follow in
the train of disease, and endeavor to aid nature
in her salutary intentions, or to remove obstacles
oiit of her path. How little, indeed, could we
accomplish without her aid! -lIt has been
wisely observed by Sir Gilbert Blane, that 'the
benefit derivable to mankind at large, from
artificial remedies, is so limited, that if a spontaneous principle of restoration had not existed,
the human species wvould long ago have been
extinct."
