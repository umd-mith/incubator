OF THE DEAD.


191


Convenience, health and decency require that
the dead should be early removed from our
sight. The law of nature requires that they
should moulder into dust, and the sooner this
change is accomplished, the better. This change
should take place, not in the immediate contiguity of survivors, not in frequented receptacles
provided for the promiscuous concentration of
numbers, not where the intruding light may
annually usher in a new tenant, to encroach
upon the old. It should take place peacefully,
silently, separately, in the retired valley, or the
sequestered wood, where the soil continues its
primitive exuberance, and where the earth has
not become too costly to afford to each occupant at least his length and breadth.
Within the bounds of populous and growing
cities, interments cannot with propriety take
place beyond a limited extent. The vacant
tracts reserved for burial grounds, and the
cellars of churches which are converted into
tombs, become glutted with inhabitants, and
are in the end obliged to be abandoned, though
not perhaps until the original tenants have been
ejected, and the same space has been occupied
