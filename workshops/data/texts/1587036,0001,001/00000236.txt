CASES OF PNEUMOTHORAX.


ease. I have seen similar cases where the pneumothorax was partial, owing to the adhesions
of the lung preventing collapse, a case not
wholly uncommon.
EXPERIMENT I.-Previously to the autopsies
of the patients who were the subjects of Cases
I. and II., a glass cylinder, open at both ends,
was pressed into close contact with the chest, so
as to hold water. Some ounces of that fluid
were poured in, and a perforation was made
through it, into the cavity of the chest on the
distended side. Immediately a large volume of
air escaped from the chest, bubbling upwards
through the water. In the third case, no cylinder being at hand, a superficial cavity was made
out of the dissected integuments of the chest,
and filled with water. Through this water a
perforation of the chest was made on the left
anterior surface. The air rushed out, producing
strong ebullition, as in the former cases. The
experiment was then repeated on the right side,
and the perforation made through water as before. No air in this instance escaped, but the
water was immediately sucked into the chest
by the atmospheric pressure.
