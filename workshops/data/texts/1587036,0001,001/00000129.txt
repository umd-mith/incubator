which they expect to acquire. Medical literature has become so vast a subject, that the
undirected student is apt to be lost in the maze
of books and sciences which seem equally to
press upon his attention. And he is likely to
fall into the pernicious error of thinking that he
must read a great deal, even though he remembers little.  The true object of a medical
pupilage should be, not to read, but to study,
