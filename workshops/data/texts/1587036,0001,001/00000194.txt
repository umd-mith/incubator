ON THE BURIAL


back part of the scalp was entirely perfect, and
had a remarkably fresh appearance; the pores
of the skin being more distinct, and the tendons
and ligaments of the neck were of considerable
substance and firmness. The hair was thick at
the back part of the head, and in appearance
nearly black. A portion of it, which has since
been cleaned and dried, is of a beautiful dark
brown color. That of the beard was a redder
brown. On the back part of the head it was
not more than an inch in length, and had probably been cut so short for the convenience of
the executioner, or perhaps by the piety of
friends soon after death, in order to furnish
memorials of the unhappy king.
'On holding up the head, to examine the
place of separation from the body, the muscles
of the neck had evidently retracted themselves
considerably; and the fourth cervical vertebra
was found to be cut through its substance
transversely, leaving the surfaces of the divided
portions perfectly smooth and even, an appearance which could have been produced only by
a heavy blow, inflicted with a very sharp instrument, and which furnished the last proof wanting to identify King Charles the First.'
