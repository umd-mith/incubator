386    ADDRESS BEFORE THE AMERICAN
uniform excess of its expenditures over its limited income, that the Academy is not able to
procure the books wanted for the information
of its members, nor to issue the publications
which should give utterance to its own investigations. So far from enjoying the promptness
and amplitude of appearance which attend the
productions of similar institutions abroad, itbhas
happened, more than once, that the discoveries
of our scientific men have had to wait, until
they were actually superseded by the same discoveries abroad, because the printed pages andthe illustrations of the engraver could not be
commanded at the requisite time.
As a nation we are proud of whatever contributes to our national glory. We are boastful
of our growth, our political progress, our victo.
ries, our annexations. We are proverbially sensitive, even in small matters, to questions of
precedence and subordination, and we give our
undivided sympathy even to a national contest
ot locksmiths.  The triumph of nautical skill
in a distant boat race binds this Union more
firmly together, by the common thrill of exultation which vibrates from Maine to Texas.
