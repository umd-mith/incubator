SELF-LIMITED DISEASES.

maladies to which this character will be found
appropriate.*
We come next to a second order of selflimited diseases, of which the term paroxysmal
is sufficiently descriptive. This term applies to
certain morbid affections, which recur in fits or
paroxysms, leaving the patient comparatively
well in the intervals, at the same time that the
paroxysms themselves can neither be foreseen,
prevented, nor, as far as we know, materially
abridged in their duration. At the head of this
subdivision stands Epilepsy, a disease which
has long been eminent as an opprobrium of
medicine, and for which, it is believed, the
healing art has not yet devised a cure. The
first attacks of epilepsy, especially while there is
any doubt as to the nature of the malady, are
usually made the subjects of active and various
treatment. But after the recurring paroxysms
have established the chardcter of the disease, if
* There is not room here to discuss the question whether
Pneumonia and other acute inflammations fall under the category
of self-limitation. Blood-letting, in proper cases, lessens the
severity and danger of these diseases. But it is not apparent
that it greatly abridges their duration. Dysentery may be
accounted a self-limited disease.
