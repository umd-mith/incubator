Bouillaud, these may be imitated by percussing
the back of the hand pressed closely upon the
ear, or by closing both ears with the palms of
the hands, and walking on a carpet in a still
room.
EXPERIMENT V.- In the body of a person
recently dead from accident, having no pneumothorax, a repetition was made of several of the
foregoing trials.  Air and water were forced
into the chest, the former so as to distend the
cavity and render percussion quite resonant.
Ebullition of the fluid was then produced by
blowing through a tube inserted between the
ribs and pushed below the surface. The only
result was a bubbling noise, having not the
slightest metallic character. It will be observed
that this was nearly a repetition of Magendie's
experiment, and it probably failed to produce
metallic sound for the same reason as in that
case, viz. that the patient was not pneumothoracic.
EXPERIMENT VI.- A bladder, and afterwards
a stomach, each containing a few ounces of
water, were inflated until thoroughly distended.
Whenever the inflating tube was pushed below
