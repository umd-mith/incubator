REMARKS ON PNEUMOTIIORAX.


any necessary agency of an echo, or reverberation of air in the cavity. This is shown particularly by the experiment of the bowl, page 203.
4. A minor, or submetallic tinkling, having no
musical resonance, may be produced by slight
impulses given to the air in the cavity, such as
the breaking of bubbles of mucus at orifices
above the surface of the liquid.
5. Amphoric resonance is produced by reverberations of the air in a vibrating cavity, without sonific impulse of the liquid. The same is
true of metallic modifications of the voice, and
of the cough when there is no tinkling. Metallic percussion seems also to depend upon the
vibrations of air independently of liquid, and
may be produced in some other cases when we
strike upon a tense cavity in which a certain
quantity of air is confined.
