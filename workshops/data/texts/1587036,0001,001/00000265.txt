circumlocution, a pharmaceutical name is. retained in the place of a more expressive chemical appellation, as in the case of alumen, bydrargyrum, ammoniatum, &amp;c. In conformity
with the present language of chemistry, the
proportional composition of bodies, it appears,
is intended to be expressed, and we have,
among other things, a bicarbonate of potass,
and a bicarbonate of soda. But this intention
is not always executed throughout the work,
which seems to us a defect in uniformity. The

is another sulphate, composed of one equivalent
of acid and one of peroxide of copper, which
is precipitated by adding pure potass to the
solution of the bisulphate above mentioned, in
a quantity insufficient for separating the whole
of the acid.
We know not for what reason it has been

commercial names of common usage, while
others, of much less frequent occurrence, are
