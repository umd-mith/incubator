SELF-LIMITED DISEASES.


tice; and a corresponding reproach awaits the
opposite course, which is cautious, palliative,
and expectant. In regard to the diseases which
have been called self-limited, I would not be
understood to deny that remedies capable of
removing them may exist; I would only assert,
that they have not yet been proved to exist.
Under the simple self-limited diseases, we
may class hooping cough. This disease has its
regular increase, height, and decline, occupying
ordinarily from one to six months, but in some
mild cases only two or three weeks. During
this period, medical treatment is for the most
part of no avail.  Narcotic appliances may
diminish the paroxysm, but without abridging
the disease. After hooping cough has reached
its climax, change of air sometimes appears to
hasten convalescence.  Also if inflammatory,
or other morbid affections, supervene upon the
pure disease, they may become subjects for
medical treatment.   With these exceptions,
hooping cough appears to be a self-limited
disease.
Most of the class of diseases usually denominated  eruptive fevers, are self-limited.
