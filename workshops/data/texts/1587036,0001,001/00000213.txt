Magendie, in his lectures quoted in the Lancet of 1835, says: ' The causes which produce
the tintement metallique, are not by any means
well understood. Suppositions have been made,
(they are made and abandoned with surprising
facility in medicine,) but when Wve come to examine them, we find nothing but mere theories
without any shadow of proof.' He tells us that
the supposition that a drop of liquid sticks to
the upper part of a cavity and then falls into
the fluid below, is mere hypothesis, which may
or may not be true. He also denies the sufficiency of the explanation that the tinkling is
caused by a bubble which traverses a fluid, and
bursts upon its surface.  His objections are
grounded on an experiment, which he proceeds
to repeat in presence of his class, showing the
insufficiency of both these causes to produce
metallic tinkling. In a dead subject, a quantity
of fluid amounting to about half a pint was
thrown into the chest. A perforation was then
made through the pulmonary tissue, so as to
establish a communication between the bronchi
and cavity of the chest. A quantity of air was
then forced in through the trachea, so as to enter
