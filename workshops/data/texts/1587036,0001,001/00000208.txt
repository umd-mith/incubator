REMARKS ON PNEUMOTHORAX.


The sounds of pneumothorax, as will appear
from the experiments detailed at the end of
this article, are divisible, with relation to their
causes, into those of impulse, and those of reverberation. The first requires the presence of
liquid, the second may take place with only the
presence of air. The first includes all the varieties of metallic tinkling which are heard in respiration, which also take place after speaking
and coughing, and which may be abundantly
produced in many cases by succussion of the
chest. When well developed it is sharp, silvery

or metallic vessel. When a sudden impetus is
