atory felt weak; pain in both back of neck and
limbs.  Felt faint in the conservatory, and
obliged to return to the open air; was nauseated, but did not vomit. Immediately walked
towards home; found her limbs unsteady, obliged
to run and then stop and support herself by the
fence; was compelled to lie down, but did not
lose consciousness; was carried home. The pain
in the back of the neck and limbs continued till
9 o'clock, when she went to bed. Had occasionally some difficulty of breathing, a catching of
the breath. In the morning was quite well.
Neither of these individuals have eaten partridges since.
The principal and most characteristic symptoms were loss of consciousness; relaxation of
the muscles, and in one instance of the sphincters; paleness; cold feet and hands; slow and
infrequent respiration, and slow and infrequent
but regular pulse. The act of vomiting was
followed by almost immediate relief.
To these cases may be added a number more,
the outlines of which have been communicated
by different medical friends.
