When the plants have attained their third
year, the collection of the leaves is commenced.
It is repeated every year until the trees are
seven or eight years old, after which they are
cut down, that they may shoot up afresh from
the roots, a process which increases the quantity of leaves.
The leaves are carefully picked off* one by
one. In Japan, the best kind, called imperial
tea, is collected at the end of February, or the
beginning of March, before the leaves are fully
unfolded. This tea is scarce and dear, and is
to prayer and contemplation. After several years, however,
being worn out with fatigue, he fell asleep against his will;
and, that he might faithfully observe his oath, which he thought
he had violated, he cut off his eyelids, and threw them on the
ground. Next day, having returned to the same spot, he found
them changed into a shrub which the earth had never before
produced. Having eaten some of the leaves of it, he found his
spirits exhilarated and his former vigor restored. He recommended this aliment to his disciples and followers. The reputation of tea increased, and after that time it continued to be
generally used. Kmmpfer, in his Amcrnitates Exotica, gives
the life with a portrait of this saint, so celebrated in China
and Japan. There is seen at the feet of Darma a reed, which
indicates that he had traversed the seas and rivers.' - Sigmond
