TREATMENT OF


both ears to some extent, but most from the
left, to which the cold application had been
made. A small slough likewise separated from
this ear.
4th day.- Additional portions had separated
from both ears, but most from the left.
From the fifth to the eighteenth day both
ears continued in a state of ulceration.  The
tip of the ears having been the first part immersed, and the last withdrawn, was of course
the most intensely scalded, and sloughed off
from both to some extent. The left ear, which
had undergone the cold treatment, suffered most
by gangrene, and was several days later than
the other in healing.
EXPERIMENT II.
The two ears of a rabbit were immersed in
scalding water as formerly. The right ear was
covered as far it was scalded with the stimulating ointment of Mr. Kentish, made of basilicon,
thinned to the consistence of a liniment with
oil of turpentine. To the left ear was applied
a saponaceous liniment, composed of equal
parts of lime water and olive oil.
