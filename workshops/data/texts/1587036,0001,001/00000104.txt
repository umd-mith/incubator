Medical instruction should be adapted to the
power of students to receive and retain what is
communicated to them, and should be confined
to what is important to them in their subsequent life.
In modern times the constituent branches of
medical science are so expanded, that they are
not acquired by any physician in a life-time,
and still less by a student during his pupilage.
The same is true even of many individual
branches. It is not, therefore, to be conceded
that 'a scheme of scientific instruction should
embrace the whole science, and no part should
be omitted;' nor that 'a well-digested plan of
lectures embraces all" that is to be known and
taught.' Medical science has at this day become so unwieldy, and contains so much that is
unnecessary, at least to beginners, that the
attempt to explain to students the whole, is
likely to involve the result of their learning but
little.
In Chemistry, at the present time, a thorough
adept is unknown. No man living knows all
the recorded facts, or all that is to be known
and taught, in that science. Organic chemistry
