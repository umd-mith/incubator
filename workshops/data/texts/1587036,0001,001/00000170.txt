TREATMENT OF

conjectural science of medicine is capable of
arriving. A desire of the truth, however, obliges
me to state the difficulties which remain, and
which may seem to detract something from the
weight of the experiments.   The ear, which
was the part subjected to experiment, is composed chiefly of cartilage and skin; it is remote
from the centre of circulation, and its powers of
life comparatively feeble. Possibly a different
mode of treatment may suit this part, from that
which agrees with muscles and cellular substance. This is not to be considered as very

than would have ensued under the use of the
