HISTORY AND USE OF TOBACCO.     329
trembling of the limbs, exsiccateth the winde
pipe, lungs and liver, annoyeth the milt, scorcheth the heart and causeth the blood to be adusted. In a word, it overthroweth the spirits,
perverteth the understanding, and confoundeth
the senses with sudden astonishment and stupiditie of the whole body.'
A poetical philippic, called' Tobacco batterred,' was published in the reign of King James,
by Joshua Sylvester, in which he compares tobacco to gunpowder, and pipes to guns; making
the mischief of the two equal. But the most
celebrated of all invectives against tobacco was
the ' Counterblast' of King James I. That
weak monarch gave vent to his prejudices
against this herb in a publication, in which he
professes to disprove all the alleged grounds for
the toleration of tobacco, and warns his subjects
in a most earnest manner not to sin against
God, and harm their own persons and goods,
and render themselves scorned and contemned
by strangers, who should come among them;
by persevering in a custom loathsome to the
eye, hateful to the nose, and baneful to the
brain.'
