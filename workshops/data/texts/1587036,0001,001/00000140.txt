you can accomplish or promise.   The skilful
mariner may steer his ship through a dangerous
navigation, but he cannot control the wind nor
arrest the storm. Nor would he gain reputation
by professing to do so.
It is hardly necessary that I should counsel
you not to neglect your patients, when you
can do anything for their welfare and security.
Neglect of outward attentions is not, I think, a
very frequent sin of physicians, inasmuch as
their interest very obviously lies in a different
course. But many practitioners fall into the
opposite error of over-attention to their patients,
of making them long, tedious or superfluous
visits, of hampering them with strict and complicated instructions, and especially of overdrugging them with remedies. There are some
patients, it is true, who like to be bled, blistered
and physicked; but the number is small, and in
most cases both the instinct of the child, and
the discretion of the grown man, cause them to
revolt against nauseous and painful inflictions.
