the part affected in cold water; and if this immersion be continued, the temperature will soon
be reduced below the natural standard. It is
true that on withdrawing the affected part, its
temperature will soon rise to the former pitch;
but this increased temperature can be nothing
more than animal heat, a little increased by the
violent action of the part, as happens in most
cases of inflammation. As to the common
phrase of 'killing the fire,' by which is meant
only the relief of pain that takes place at the
commencement of resolution or suppuration;
