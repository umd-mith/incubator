cine,;the literature of which is a vast magazine
of rubbish, with a few gems imbedded in it,
accumulated in all time since the origin of
writing, and in such excess that no country in
Europe could probably furnish even a catalogue
of its own modern books. The history of this
extensive science contains a mixture of much
that is bad, with much less that is good. And
although in medical research the still small
voice of truth has from time to time made itself
heard for a season, yet it has as often been
drowned by the dogmas of the visionary and
the clamors of the interested. During the present century a host of theorists and gratuitous
reformers have replaced each other on the arena
of medical controversy. But we have seen that
while a truth in medical science, like the import
of the physical signs for example, struggles its
way through opposition and distrust into general adoption,-an unfair and unfounded assumption rarely survives long the life of the
individual whose own eloquence and obstinacy
were necessary to force it for a time upon the
public attention.
