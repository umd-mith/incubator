ADDRESS BEFORE THE AMERICAN


attracting them towards each other, published
an elaborate memoir, entitled 'Observations
tending to prove by phenomena and scripture,
the existence of an orb which surrounds the
visible material system, and which may be
necessary to preserve it from the ruin to which,
without such a counterbalance, it seems liable,
by that universal principle in matter, gravitation.'
The author satisfies himself by a train of
ingenious reasoning, of the sufficiency of his
theory to prevent the apprehended catastrophe.
He deals not only with the necessities of such
an arrangement to produce stability in our universe, but draws supernumerary arguments from
the presence of the milky way, the blue color of
the firmament, and lastly from various corroborative texts of scripture.
History is silent in regard to the extent of the
impression made upon the world by the promulgation of this.comprehensive theory. The orb
is supposed to have been standing several years
after the announcement of its character and
office,-and when it fell, the Academy, nothing
daunted, proceeded to prosecute its celestial in.
