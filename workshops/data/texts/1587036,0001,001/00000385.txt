marked these early stages of scientific inquiry,
we have at least the gratifying assurance, that
our philosophic fathers did not close their ears
against the reception of knowledge, from whatever quarter it might proceed. They were just
emerging from the deep intellectual darkness,
which for long ages had brooded over the world.
They were the survivors of many generations,
among whom to inquire had been a crime, to
reason had been a heresy, and to experiment a
satisfactory evidence of intercourse with the
powers of darkness. Secretly, and by stealth
and stratagem, the germs of science had here
and there been nourished into visible life, but
the air and the sunlight of heaven w~re denied
to their upward expanding tendencies.  And
when at length, with the Reformation, the revival of letters and the introduction of the printing press, a veil was lifted from the moral and
material world, no wonder that inquiring eyes
were dazzled and strong heads were turned with
the startling developments of the solar system,
the circumnavigation of the globe, and the practicable intercourse of men and nations with each
other.
