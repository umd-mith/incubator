early botanists in the prosecution of their inquiries, from the novelty of the subject, the paucity
of books, and the difficulty of maintaining correspondence with foreign scientific authorities,
in those cases where books are insufficient and
knowledge to a certain extent must be ocular
and traditionary. Yet the Rev. Dr. Cutler, of
our State, has culled for himself an enduring
garland from a field in which it would appear
that the harvest was plenteous, but the laborers
were few.
