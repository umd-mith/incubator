REMARKS ON PNEUMOTHORAX.

liquid contained in a preternatural cavity formed in the chest.* This explanation may have
been suggested by a note of M. Meriadec Laennec in his edition of the great work of his relative, who says that the sound in question
appears to depend upon the vibration of a gas
upon the surface of a liquid.
Dr. James Houghton, author of the article
Pneumothorax in the Cyclopedia of practical
medicine, adopts the idea of an echo, which he
derives both from the dropping of fluid in a
cavity, and from the entrance of air through a
fistulous opening. The latter variety, he says,
appears to be manifestly the echo of the air
forced into the cavity, reverberating against its
hollow parietes; and the sound, he thinks, is
more particularly caused by the bursting of
minute air bubbles at the orifice of the fistula,
formed as the air traverses the latter by the entanglement of mucus. He thinks that the tinkling will be more or less loud and distinct in
proportion as the fistulous opening is larger or
smaller.
