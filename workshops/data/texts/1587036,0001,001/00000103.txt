PRACTICAL VIEWS


ON
MEDICAL EDUCATION.
PUBLISHKD BY VOTE OF THE MEDICAL FACULTY OF nARVARD
umvERsITY iN 1860.          1
THE undecided state of public opinion in regard to some of the fundamental points in a
course of medical education, including among
other things the portion of the term of pupilage
proper to be spent in attendance on lectures, is
thought to justify a further consideration of the
subject. In some of its relations, this subject
has already been discussed, in the Transactions
of the American Medical Association for 1849,
in two reports, pages 353 and 359, to which the
reader is particularly referred. The following
condensed, but more general view of the subject
of medical education, is now respectfully submitted to the members of the Association.
