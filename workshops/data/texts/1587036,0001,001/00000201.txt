OF THE DEAD.

selves in contemplating the wrecks of humanity,
which have occasionally been brought to light,
are such as lead us to ask, of what possible
use is a resistance to the laws of nature, which,
when most successfully executed, can at best
only preserve a defaced and degrading image
of what was once perfect and beautiful? Could
we, by any means, arrest the progress of decay,
so as to gather round us the dead of a hundred
generations in a visible and tangible shape;
could we fill our houses and our streets with
mummies, - what possible acquisition could
be more useless, what custom could be more
revolting? - For precisely the same reason the
subterranean vaults and the walls of brick,
which we construct to divide the clay of humanity from that of the rest of creation, and to
preserve it separate for a time, as it were for
future inspection, are neither useful, gratifying,
nor ultimately effectual. Could the individuals
themselves, who are to be the subjects of this
care, have the power to regulate the officious
zeal of their survivors, one of the last things
they could reasonably desire would be, that the
light should ever shine on their changed and
crumbling relics.
