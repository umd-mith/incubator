however, they penetrate the fibrbus textures and
the cavities of the joints. These concretions
are fluid, or semifluid, when first effused, but
become gradually solid by the absorption of
their fluid parts.  They finally become hard
and friable, resembling common chalk in their
appearance. In their more fluid state they are
formed of hydrated lithate of soda, but the
solid concretions consist mainly of lithate of
soda, with some phosphate of lime.
The chalky concretions are liable to grow
with the return of every paroxysm. In bad
cases the skin finally gives way, and a chalky
serous fluid is discharged. This is afterwards
replaced by a kind of chalky pus, and in this
manner a part of the chalk escapes, but never

cells and textures. Persons have been known
to write their names with the denuded chalk
protruding from the knuckles. Sometimes the
apertures close over and cicatrize, but are liable
to break out again during subsequent paroxysms. Chalk stones are most common in the
joints of the hands and feet, which they distort
in an unsightly manner. They may, however,
