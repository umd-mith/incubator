330     HISTORY AND USE OF TOBACCO.
Such were the commotions excited by the
introduction and spreading of an article, the use
of which has now become so common as scarcely to attract notice. This article is the product
of several species of Nicotiana, but chiefly of
the N. tabacum or Virginian tobacco, and the
N. rustica, sometimes called English tobacco,
and being the sort which Sir Walter Raleigh
introduced at the court of Queen Elizabeth.
Another species, N. fruticosa, is said to have
been cultivated in the East prior to the discovery
of America. The Indians on the banks of the
Missouri and Columbia rivers cultivate for use
the N. quadrivalvis of Pursh and Nuttall. It
has been remarked that the tobacco of warm
climates is more mild in its flavor, while that
raised in colder latitudes is more strong and
pungent. The Bengal tobacco, of which the
sheroots are made, is one of the most mild in its
properties. After this is the West India tobacco which affords the Havana cigars. Next is
the tobacco of our Southern States, and lastly
the tobacco raised in the northern parts of the
Union, which is the most acrimonious and pungent of all.
