REMARKS ON PINEUMOTHORAX:
WITH CASES, AND AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES
OF THE METALLIC SOUNDS HEARD IN THAT DISEASE.
[From the American Journal of Medical Sciences, 1839.]
THE sounds which are heard during auscultation in  cases of pneumothorax, especially
when life has been prolonged for a considerable
time under the disease, have a character, of
which the term metallic is eminently descriptive.  This character may be recognized not
only in the respiration and cough, but frequently
also in the voice and the succussion and percussion of the chest. The sound is either sharp
and tinkling, or it is prolonged, reverberating
and ringing, according to the kind of action
under which it is produced. In both cases the
mechanical condition of the chest is apparently
the same.
