TREATMENT OF


mode of treatment afforded the most immediate
ease to the patient, as well as the most expeditious cure.  According to the patient's own
account, the pain of the hands and face was
immediately relieved by the cold application,
but he complained of the oil of turpentine occasioning a smarting sensation on the back for
five or six hours. This mode of dressing was
continued for the space of two days; but observing a considerable degree of inflammation
remaining from the terebinthinate application,
that dressing was changed for the neutralized
cerate, which the patient did not observe, his
eyes being closed by the great tumefaction of
the face; but he expressed the utmost satisfaction from the superior comfort he felt in that
dressing compared with the former. The next
day the back appeared much less inflamed, continued gradually getting better, and was cured
in three weeks. " I am confident," says Dr.
Evans, the relater of the case, "the back would
have gotten well sooner under the cooling plan
of treatment; for the patient constantly complained of the great heat in the part during
the application of the oil of turpentine."'
