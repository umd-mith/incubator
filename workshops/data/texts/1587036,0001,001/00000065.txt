the alimentary canal. Buried in this substance,
they resist the effect of the most violent cathartics and vermifuges, oil of turpentine and croton
not excepted. If it be permitted to derive an
hypothesis from the phenomena which they
exhibit, it would be, that during a greater part
of the.time, they remain quietly embedded in
this mucus, deriving from it their habitation and
nourishment, being at the same time secured
from the effects of the peristaltic motion by
this and by the ahhesive power of suction; but
that at certain periods, perhaps at their generating seasons, they issue forth from this covert,
and mingle themselves in the contents of the
alimentary canal; in consequence of which they
are liable to be expelled with the common mass.
I have known ascarides to be eradicated by a
severe dysentery. In some cases they have been
totally removed by large injections of oil, particularly of lamp oil. But more frequently they
resist these and most other remedies for a series
of years. A temporary palliative may always
be found in small injections of weak salt water,
or even of an ounce or two of cold water.
