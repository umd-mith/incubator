200      REMARKS ON PNEUMOTHORAX.
Mr. Guthrie, in the London Medical and Surgical Journal, 1833, asserts that Laennec, and
also all who hold that metallic tinlding 'depends
entirely on the passage of air through a hole in
the lung into the cavity of the thorax,' have
been mistaken, and in opposition to this he
mentions that to produce the sound in question,
the air in the cavity must necessarily be compressed.  I do not,' says he, 'deny the facts of
the air, the hole in the lung, or the fluid; but I
believe that to produce the sounds of the Jews'
harp (metallic tinkling) the air in the cavity
must be greatly compressed.'
M. Beau, a French writer on the causes of the
respiratory bruits, is not satisfied with the explanation of Laennec, and contends that metallic tinkling is produced by a bubble of air,
which having traversed the fluid, bursts upon
its surface. He founds his opinion on the fact,
that he has never witnessed metallic tinkling,
when the communication with the external air
was above the level of the fluid. Dr. Spittal, of
Edinburgh, seems to have suggested this explanation of metallic tinkling by the bursting of air
bubbles, as early as 1830.
