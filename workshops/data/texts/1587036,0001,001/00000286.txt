274    ON THE POISONOUS EFFECTS OF
selected from among a larger number, which
have been observed by myself or my medical
friends, and of which a part are in the records
of the Society of Medical Improvement.
CASE I.- A gentleman of this city having
dined at Worcester in part upon partridge, took
the cars for Boston half an hour afterward.
In an hour after entering, he was taken with
sensations like those of sea sickness, accompanied with dizziness and great prostration of
strength. With difficulty he got his head out
and vomited from the window of the car. He
continued faint, cold, dizzy, and unable to sit
up, with ringing in the ears and imperfect vision.
He was conveyed to his house in a sinking and
nearly insensible state. When I first saw him,
he was cold and moist, with a slow intermittent
and very feeble pulse, difficult comprehension,
and sluggish utterance. He had vomited again
with some relief. His vision was partially recovered. Stimulants had been given him, with
hot applications and frictions to the surface,
under which he gradually recovered.
