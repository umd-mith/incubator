ed by the resonance of air, agitated upon the
surface of a liquid, seems to be too vague and
unsupported to require particular attention.
In'regard to the explanations given by Drs.
Williams and Houghton, which ascribe metallic
tinkling to an echo, or reverberation of air from
the sides of a cavity, the solution seems to me
to be neither adequate nor very probable. Echo
is the secondary sound produced by the reflected vibrations of the atmosphere. It becomes
powerful only when many reflections converge
towards the same point. Air, moreover, is a
feeble conductor of sound, when compared with
liquid or solid bodies. It is unnecessary, therefore, to suppose that one of the most striking
sounds heard in auscultation, is produced by the
secondary movement of a feeble conductor,
when we have between the ear and the place of
impulse, the direct agency of a much more powerful conductor, viz. a liquid. To elucidate
this point, let any one perform the following
experiment. Into a large earthen or porcelain
bowl, pour a few ounces of water. Then produce a slight and barely audible sound, by rubbing or snapping together the ends of the nails
