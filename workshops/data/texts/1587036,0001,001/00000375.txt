ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES.   363
Institute, has during a long period of years, sustained an almost uninterrupted preeminence in
the republic of letters. The labors of this body
have cast a flood of light on modern science,
and its assembled savans have formed a tribunal
from whose scientific sentence there seemed no
appeal. Yet even this institution, under the
occasional supineness of its members, and the
influence of royal favoritism, has more than
once been 'a mark for the shafts of cotemporaneous criticism. The poet Piron, affecting to
define his own humble position by an epitaph,
says, ' Here lies Piron, who was nothing at all,
not even an Academician.'
In the year 1779, in the midst of the exhausting and yet unfinished contest of our Revolution,
with humble resources, but with confidence of
future promise, the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences was founded by an association of
citizens of Massachusetts. The fathers of our
Commonwealth, well aware that the lights of
liberty and learning are jointly conducive to the
stability of free government, gave their sanction
and in many cases their individual efforts to
construct the foundation of an ample edifice.
