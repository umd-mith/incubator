SELF-LIMITED DISEASES.


'has been particularly successful; for where the
writers have furnished us anything like definite,
'or numerical results, it does not appear that the
-mortality was less in their hands than it is,among those who pursue a more expectant,practice. The post mortuary appearances, which
in many diseases furnish useful lessons for prac~tice, are in scarlet fever extremely various and
-uncertain; and sometimes no morbid changes,
-sufficient to account for death, can be discovered
in any of the vital organs, or great cavities.

Small Pox is another example of the class of
-affections under consideration, its approach and
-disappearance being irrespective of medical,practice. It may, at first view, appear, that
inoculation has placed artificial limits on this,disease. But it must be recollected, that inocu-lated small pox is itself only a milder variety
-of the same disease, having its own customary
-limits of extent' and duration, which are fixed,
-quite as much as those of the distinct and con4luent forms of the natural disease.
Erysipelas is an eruptive fever, having strong:analogies with those which have been detailed.
