cerate of lapis calaminaris.

Kentish is also stimulant. Wine, ale, alcohol
or laudanum, are advised to be used according

Sir James Earle, in a publication, entitled
'An Essay on the Means of lessening the Effects of JFire on the Human Body,' defends a
mode of treatment direcdy the reverse of the
former. This consists of the antiphlogistic regimen internally, together with the application of
cold in the form of water, snow, or pounded ice,
to the part affected. Sir Walter Farquhar and
Dr. Kinglake advocate the same mode of procedure; and the cases related to substantiate
the happy effect of the cooling treatment are
not less numerous than those in favor of the
terebinthinate remedies.
