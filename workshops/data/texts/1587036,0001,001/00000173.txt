4 INJURIES'BY FIRE.


161


In a variety of cases which have occurred
under my own observation, it has not been
practicable to contrast the effects of different
dressings; so that little of a decisive nature
can be gathered from them. In one case, however, which I witnessed, of a very severe and
extensive burn in a child aged ten years, which
was occasioned by the clothes taking fire, and
which afterward terminated fatally; the application of the oil of turpentine in the form of a
liniment produced the most violent aggravation
of pain, which did not cease before the patient
was thrown into convulsions. Instances of the
same effect have been mentioned to me by
several medical friends.
Most writers, who appear as principal advocates of any mode of practice, feel obliged to
produce something like a theory or rationale,
which shall account for, or at least apply to the
facts and phenomena adduced. Accordingly,
Mr. Kentish and the others have not omitted
to back their catalogue of cases with a train of
reasoning illustrative of the propriety of their
special applications. Of these the two principal are entitled to a separate attention.
