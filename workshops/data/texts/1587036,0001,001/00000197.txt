be visible. At the close of the next summer,
the entire flank of the animal had been thawed

this inclement region, to thaw the ice, so that
the whole body could be liberated. At length,
in 1804, the enormous mass separated from the
mountain of ice, and fell over upon its side,
on a sand bank. At this time it appears to
have been in a state of perfect preservation,
with its skin and flesh as entire as when it had
existed antecedently to the deluge, or to whatever convulsion of the globe may have transported animals apparently of the torrid zone to
