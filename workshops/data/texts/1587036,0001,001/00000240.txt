CASES OF PNEUMOTHORAX.


the surface of the liquid, and the inflation continued so as to produce bubbles, a sharp tinkling was heard upon the explosion of every
bubble, by the ear applied as in, ausculting to
the outside of the bladder. In this experiment
the sound becomes more exquisitely metallic, in
proportion as the tension of the bladder is increased by farther inflation. Succussion, of the
bladder produces a similar effect. It is necessary that a recent bladder should be used, the
texture and elasticity of which are not altered
by drying. When the orifice of the tube is
above the surface of the water) also when no
water is present in the bladder, an intense amphoric sound is produced during inflation; and
if saliva or other liquid, in small quantities, is
blown through the inflating tube, a more feeble,
or submetallic tinkling is produced.
From the foregoing experiments and cases,
we may infer that the following agencies are
concerned in producing metallic sounds of the
chest.
1. There must be a cavity, the walls of which
are preternaturally susceptible of vibration.
