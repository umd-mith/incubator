ON THE BURIAL


On the other hand, when nature is permitted
to take its course, when the dead are committed
to the earth under the open sky, to become
early and peacefully blended with their original
dust, no unpleasant association remains.  It
would seem as if the forbidding and repulsive
conditions which attend on decay, were merged
and lost in the surrounding harmonies of the
creation.
When the body of Major Andre was taken
up, a few years since, from the place of its in.
terment near the Hudson, for the purpose of
being removed to England, it was found that
the skull of that officer was closely encircled by
a network, formed by the roots of a small tree,
which had been planted near his head. This
is a natural and most beautiful coincidence.
It would seem as if a faithful sentinel had
taken his post, to watch, till the obliterated
ashes should no longer need a friend. Could
we associate with inanimate clay any of the
feelings of sentient beings, who would not wish
to rescue his remains from the prisons of mankind, and commit them thus to the embrace of
nature?
