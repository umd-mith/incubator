self-reliance, and a fear of being thought behind
the literature of their time.
The length of a course of lectures is not the
measure of its value to the student. A course
of lectures should not outlast the curiosity of
its hearers, nor their average pecuniary ability
to attend. Custom in this country has generally
fixed the limits of these things at about four
months. A comprehensive and judicious course,
confined to the enforcing of necessary points,
is far more profitable than a more discursive
course to a wearied and diminishing audience.
Lectures are chiefly wanted to impress by demonstration the practical branches of science,
and they are most effective in places where the
facilities for such demonstrations can be commanded. Anatomy requires extensive exhibitions by the teacher, and personal dissections by
the student. Chemistry and Materia Medica
require illustrations by specimens and experiments. Pathology neeas the aid of autopsies,
museums and the clinical demonstrations of
large hospitals. A knowledge of Obstetrics is
not perfected without apparatus and practice.
