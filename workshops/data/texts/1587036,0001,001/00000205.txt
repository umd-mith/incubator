OF THE DEAD.

enduring memorials of marble and granite, a
landscape of the most picturesque character
wil be created. No place in the environs of
our city will possess stronger attractions to the
visiter.  To the mourner it offers seclusion,
amid the consoling influences of nature. The
moralist and man of religion will
' Find room
And food for meditation, nor pass by
Much, that may give him pause, if pondered fittingly.'
We regard the relics of our deceased friends
and kindred for what they have been, and not
for what they are. We cannot keep in our
presence the degraded image of the original
frame; and if some memorial is necessary to
soothe the unsatisfied want, which we feel
when bereaved of their presence, it must be
found in contemplating the place in which we
know that their dust is hidden. The history
of mankind, in all ages, shows that the human
heart clings to the grave of its disappointed
wishes, that it seeks consolation in rearing
emblems and monuments, and in collecting
images of beauty over the disappearing relics
