which it is taken, that enables patients at all
times to swallow it with impunity, as a medicine.
It is a field of interesting inquiry to ascertain
how far particular morbid poisons and stimulants confine their action to particular textures.
As far as my observation extends, the cutaneous
poisons which produce eruptions on the skin
independent of any acrimony, or general stimulating quality, such as the Rhus vernix, &amp;c.,
