316     ACTION OF COCHITUATE WATER
well-marked cases of the diseases usually attributed to lead, have occurred, which were not
traceable to some other cause than the use of
Cochituate water drawn from leaden pipes.
It appears from the experiments of Professor
Horsford, that the water of the Schuylkill and
Croton rivers, and of Jamaica and Cochituate
lakes, acts upon the surface of the lead so as to
take up a small portion of that metal during the
first two or three days of its contact. But after
a few days the surface of the lead becomes coated with an insoluble compound which protects
the lead for the most part from the further
action of the water. Nevertheless, traces of lead
are reported to have been found by various
chemists in specimens of some of these waters,
when greatly reduced by evaporation.
In consequence of the extensive use made of
lead for various economical purposes, no person
in civilized society can expect to escape from
the reception of that metal in minute quantities
into the body. The presence of lead in the
paint of dwelling-houses and furniture, of waterbuckets and other culinary apparatus, in vessels
made of leaden alloys or soldered with the same,
