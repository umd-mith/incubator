286    ON THE POISONOUS EFFECTS OF
out the winter. We have hardly any species of
game which is sought for with more avidity, or
consumed, in proportion to its size, in greater
numbers. As a general rule, it is, and may be
taken with perfect impunity.
The fact that the meat of the partridge occasionally proves poisonous, has given rise to
much speculation in regard to the cause. The
point most generally admitted respecting it, is,
that its bad effects chiefly, if not always, take
place in winter, when the ground is covered
with snow. This circumstance has given rise
to a popular belief that the noxious quality in
the meat of the bird is attributable to some poisonous food on which, in winter, it is driven to
subsist.  And a prevalent suspicion has been
fixed upon the mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia),
on the buds and leaves of which the partridge
has been supposed to feed in cold weather.
But this suspicion appears to be not well founded, since I have observed in experiments made

would be likely to devour; and the crops, when
