Two years after this event, Mr. Adams, being

mutilated by the dogs and wolves of the neighborhood, which had fed upon its flesh as fast
as it thawed. He however succeeded in removing the whole skeleton, and in recovering
two of the feet, one of the ears, one of the
eyes, and about three quarters of the skin,
which was covered with reddish hair and black
bristles. These are now in the museum at St.
Petersburg.
The foregoing facts are sufficient to show
that a Jow degree of temperature is an effectual
preventive of animal decomposition.  On the
other hand, a certain degree of heat combined
with a dry atmosphere, although a less perfect
protection, is sufficient to check the destructive
process.  Warmth, combined with moisture,
tends areatly to promote decomposition; yet if
the degree of heat, or the circumstances under
which it acts, are such as to produce a perfect
dissipation of moisture, the further progress of
