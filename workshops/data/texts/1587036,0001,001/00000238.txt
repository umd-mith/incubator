CASES OF PNEUMOTHORAX.,above the level of the fluid, a strong amphoric
-buzzing was communicated to the ear of an ob-server in contact with the chest. But when the
end of the instrument was pushed below the
surface of the liquid, and the latter made to
'bubble by continuing the inflation, an exquisite
-metallic tinkling was heard at the explosion of
each bubble, resembling, as it had done in
'life, the sound of a little bell or musical wire.,In the subject of Case III. this experiment
-was repeated, and varied by pouring into the
'chest different quantities of water. When a
few ounces only were present, metallic tinkling
-was uniformly produced, but when two quarts
-or more were introduced, a bubbling only was
heard, without metallic resonance. Similar results were also obtained by pouring a small
stream, or letting fall drops of water from above
upon the liquid in the chest.
EXPERIMENT IV. - Succussion and percussion were both found to produce the same metallic sounds in the dead body as during life in
Case II. Metallic sounds elicited by percussion
somewhat resemble those occasionally yieldedby the heart, and, as has been observed by
