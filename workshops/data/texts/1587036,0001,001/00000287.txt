THE AMERICAN PARTRIDGE.


275


CASE II. - A lady of delicate health took at
dinner a small piece of the breast and leg of a
partridge.  Two hours afterward she became
suddenly very faint, and her physician (Dr. Putnam) was called. She was found by him in a
sitting posture on the bed, supported by two
assistants, with the body bent forward.  The
surface was generally cold, countenance pale
and sunken, and voice feeble.    There was
slight, frequent convulsive action of the muscles.
The pupils were dilated, with loss of vision.
Pulse irregular, feeble, at times nearly imperceptible. There was drowsiness approaching
to insensibility, nausea and vomiting. Spirituous stimulants were given and ipecacuanha,
with warmth, friction and sinapisms externally.
Soon after free vomiting took place there was
evident amendment. The sensibility returned,
questions were comprehended, but the answers
were slow and laborious. In the course of two
or three hours vision was restored with contraction of the pupils and intolerance of light, with
a remaining sense of numbness and uneasiness
in the head.
