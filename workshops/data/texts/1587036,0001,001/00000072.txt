known, there can be no difference of opinion.
In like manner, chemistry and mechanics, astronomy and portions of natural history, are
examples of exact sciences, the demonstrations
of which, when once made clear, may afterwards be modified and enlarged, but are never
fundamentally shaken. On the other hand, the
important sciences of ethics and politics, of
commerce and finance, of government, and
speculative theology, are inexact in many of
their principles, as is proved by the widely
different constructions under which men receive and apply them to practice.
It would at first seem that the exact sciences
were those most worthy the cultivation of intelligent minds, inasmuch as they lead to satisfactory, and therefore to gratifying results; and
because, in their more elevated departments,
they involve and require some of the highest
reaches of the human intellect. But in the
qpinions of mankind, as evinced by their practice, the opposite judgment prevails, and probably nine-tenths of the labor of educated and
intellectual men are employed on studies which
are, in their nature, uncertain and conjectural.
