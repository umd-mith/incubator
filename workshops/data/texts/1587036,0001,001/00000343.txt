HISTORY AND USE OF TOBACCO.


331


Chemists have extracted from tobacco a color:
less liquid alkaloid, which they have called Nicotine. It is acrid to the taste and smell, forms
neutral compounds with acids, and is intensely
poisonous in minute quantities. NVicotianine,
another product, is a concrete volatile oil, like
camphor, and resembles tobacco in its properties.
Among the substances used by Sir Benjamin
Brodie in his experiments on vegetable poisons,
was an empyreumatic oil of tobacco prepared
by Mr. Brande by distilling the leaves of tobacco
in a heat above that of boiling water. A quantity of watery fluid came over, on the surface of
which was a film of unctuous substance, which
he calls the empyreumatic oil. Mr. Brodie
found that two drops of this oil applied to the
tongue of a young cat with an interval of fifteen
minutes occasioned death. A single drop suspended in an ounce of water and injected into
the rectum of a cat, produced death in about
five minutes. One drop suspended in an ounce
and a half of mucilage and thrown into the rectum of a dog, produced violent symptoms, and
a repetition of the experiment killed him.
