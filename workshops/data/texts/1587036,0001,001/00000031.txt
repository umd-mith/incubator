Nathan Smith, in the course of some remarks

my practice I have never been satisfied that I

Louis, Gastro-entErite. IT. 612.

funeste. - Clinique III. 616, 617.
t At the time of the publication alluded to, the distinction between typhus and typhoid fevers had not been well made out.
The distinction is good, though writers of authority differ on the
subject.
