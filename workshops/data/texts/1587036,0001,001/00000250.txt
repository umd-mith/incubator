maintain their ground against all chemical interference. The combined learning of two hemispheres is unable to prevail against copperas
and cream of tartar, and the manufacturer and
merchant still continue to make, sell and buy
their tartar emetic without troubling themselves
to inquire whether it is a ' tartrate,' or a ' cream
tartrate,' or neither. Nay, in some instances
the vulgar appellations have turned the tables
upon the classical and scientific, and the homely
name of potash has dictated to the learned their
more elegant potass and potassium.
To combine in practice the expressiveness
and precision of one language with the durability of the other, though very desirable, would,
from the nature of the subject, be impossible.
Yet an approach may be made to the advantages of both, by adopting, in the first instance,
a descriptive language founded on the existing
state of science at:the time, and afterwards to
declare it perpetual, or at least to establish it
in force during a long term of years. We should
thus possess a medium of communication in
itself entitled to respect, and rendered more
valuable by the prospect of being permanent.
