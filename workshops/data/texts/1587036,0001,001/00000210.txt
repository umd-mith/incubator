drop of water let fall into a flask three quarters
empty, and this sound is immediately followed
by a distinct metallic tinkling. A similar sound
he says may be heard by ausculting the epigastrium of a person who is swallowing water in
minute quantities. This explanation has been
adopted by various subsequent writers, as a
general mode of accounting for the phenomenon
of metallic tinkling.
Dr. C. J. B. Williams, author of valuable
works on diseases of the lungs and pleura, explains metallic tinkling on the principle of
reverberation or echo, produced in a cavity of
uniformly reflecting parietes by the communication of a sound, or of a soniferous impulse to
the air contained within it. He considers that
in common cases of pneumothorax communicating with a bronchus, if the fistulous opening
be small, metallic tinkling will be produced, but
if large, or if several such openings exist, there
will be only amphoric resonance.
Dr. Thomas Davies, in his lectures at the
London Hospital on diseases of the chest, says:
' The metallic tinkling is caused by the resonance of air agitated upon the surface of a
