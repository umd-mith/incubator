SELF-LIMITED DISEASES.


fever are extremely various. Rheumatic affections are among the most common. Dropsical
effusions are frequent, both in the cellular texture and in large cavities. Anasarca and ascites
are not of uncommon occurrence. I have seen
hydrocele, which disappeared spontaneously in
a few weeks, and hydrocephalus which proved
fatal. Troublesome indurations of the parotid
and submaxillary glands often occur, and may,
or may not, be followed by suppuration. A
fatal induration of the whole anterior neck is
sometimes met with. This I have seen both in
the primary and secondary disease. A purulent
or sanious discharge from the ears occasionally
follows scarlet fever, and sometimes continues
long enough to destroy the organic texture, and
with it the sense of hearing, in one or both ears.
Erysipelas and roseola are among the other
pearances which I have seen to supervene upon
this uncertain disease. Fortunately, however,
the largest portion of cases are attended with no
sequele, or with such as disappear spontaneously in their own time, without permanent
injury to the patient.
