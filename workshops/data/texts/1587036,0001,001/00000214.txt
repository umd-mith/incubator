REMARKS ON PNEUMOTHORAX.


the pleural cavity. No metallic sound was produced in the operation. Water was then dropped in through an opening in the upper part of
the chest upon the fluid below, but this also
produced no tinkling.  Another orifice was
made in the lung beneath the surface of the
fluid, and air injected as before. A bubbling
sound, or craquement' was heard in the chest,
'but nothing of a metallic or tinkling character
could be perceived. Magendie considers himself as having disproved the explanations to
which his experiments relate, but he does not
offer any new one of his own.
In regard to M. Guthrie's explanation, which
supposes the necessity of compressed air being
-present, this has been effectually set aside by
the fact, that although in extreme pneumothorax, the air in the pleura is moderately compressed, yet metallic tinkling is known to be
also produced in large tubercular cavities of the
lungs, which communicate freely with the atmosphere, and therefore are not subject to any
compression whatever.
The solution of this phenomenon given by
Dr. Davies, and Laennec Junior, that it is caus
