ON THE EARLY


daughters of Prcetus, of real or pretended madness, that he might gain the hand of one of his
patients, together with her kingdom, in marriage; while with regard to Orpheus, there is
very little authority for his having practised
physic in any particular instance, and his high
reputation is sufficiently supported by the established fact, that
' He played so well, he moved Old Nick.'
On considerations like the foregoing we are
disposed to ascribe to the ancient Greeks the
credit of very little real proficiency in the art
of healing.  From   similar motives we doubt
the correctness of Dr. Miller's belief, that Greece
was indebted for its first discoveries and improvements in medicine solely to two classes of
men, viz. the chiefs or sovereigns, and the priests
or ministers of religion. Unwilling, however,
to interfere with the doctor's ardor for classification, we only suggest, for a second edition of
his work, the propriety of adding a new class or
department in primitive physic, to be called the
department of old women, or of female medicine.
