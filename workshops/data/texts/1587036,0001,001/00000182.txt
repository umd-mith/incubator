INJURIES BY FIRE.


passive kind, with diminished action of the
part, and atony and prostration of strength in
the system, we may then depend on stimulants
and antiseptics. It can be only in burns of this
kind that Mr. Kentish's method of treatment
is admissible in any extent.
In the subsequent treatment of burns, if exuberant granulations arise, they may be repressed by gentle astringents, by pressure, or by
escharotics. Mr. Kentish recommends powdered chalk, but this I have found insufficient
when mixed with a third part of burnt alum.
Pure alum answers the purpose perfectly well.
The separation of sloughs is facilitated, according to Mr. Kentish, by introducing powdered chalk into the cavities between them and
the living parts.
The contraction of the cicatrix is often an
unpleasant consequence of burns. It may be
obviated in a degree by a proper position of
the cicatrizing part. Sometimes the contraction is so great as to impede circulation; in
which case it is necessary to divide the newly
formed skin in different places, thus allowing it
room to expand.
