in the air in any part of the cavity of the bowl
above the water, it remains feeble, but if the
nails be immersed below the surface of the water, the sound instantly becomes augmented to
many times its former intensity, and it will be
particularly intense to the ear of an ausculter
applied to the outside of the bowl. Here, then,
is a parallel case. The liquid in Pneumothorax
and not the air, as will hereafter be seen, conveys the sound of metallic tinkling to the walls
of the chest, and these transmit it to the ear of
the ausculter, constituting an uninterrupted
chain of vibrations.
Considering the subject as being yet imperfectly explained, and therefore open to further
inquiry, I have made some experiments in connection with the following cases, which I hope
will not be found irrelevant to the question.
