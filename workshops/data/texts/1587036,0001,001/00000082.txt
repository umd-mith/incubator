TREATMENT OF DISEASE.


only have caught, they have only to be liberated,
and if the pivots are dry and rough, they must
be oiled or cleaned;-and lastly, if the watch
has had a destructive fall, if it has been crushed
by being trodden on, if it has lain a month in
the salt water, or if it is worn out by running
steadily for threescore years and ten, then the
case is incurable, and the only palliative *advice
which the practitioner can render is, that the
owner should procure a new watch, or reconcile
himself to do without one.
But suppose there resides in the place a
watch doctor who prescribes for symptoms, and
who, among other things, has a remedy for the
symptom of stopping, and that this remedy consists in a certain kind of friction, shaking, or
manipulation, an ointment applied to the outside, or an invisible particle of some nugatory
substance inserted into the inside; and suppose
that one or two watches in a hundred which
had stopped by accident, should by accident
resume their motions under such treatment,
could anything but the most unmitigated folly
draw the inference that such a person is entitled
to become the accredited horologer to the community?
