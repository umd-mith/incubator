GREAT SINGERS.

tune is made." As a result of the praises so
loudly chanted by the Princess of Modena, the
child was sent for to sing in the King's Chapel,
and, in spite of the aversion of Anne's pious mother, who was afraid with good reason of the influences of the dissipated court, she was placed thus
in contact with power and royalty. The beautiful Pompadour heard her charming voice, and remarked, with that effusion of sentiment which
veneered her cruel selfishness, "Ah! with such a
talent, she might become a princess." This opinion of the imperious and all - powerful favorite
decided the girl's fate; for it was equivalent to a
mandate for her debut. The precocious child knew
the danger of the path opened for her. To the
remonstrances of her mother she said with a shrug
of her pretty shoulders: " To go to the opera is to
go to the devil. But what matters it? It is my
destiny."   Poor Mme. Arnould scolded, shuddered, and prayed, and ended it, as she thought,
by shutting the girl up in a convent. But Louis
XV. got wind of this threatened checkmate, and
a royal mandate took her out of the convent
walls which had threatened to immure her for
life. Anne was placed with Clairon, the great
tragedienne, to learn acting, and with Mille. Fel
to learn singing. As, a consequence, while she
had some rivals in the beauty of her voice, her
acting surpassed anything on the operatic stage
of that era.
