GREAT SINGERS.

sire to excel, and the exquisite fusion of the two
voices, so different in tone and character, was so

each other, and they professed mutual friendship.
The London public got the benefit of this amity,
for the manager of the King's Theatre was able
to produce operas in which they sang together,
among them being " Semiramide," " Don Giovanni," "Nozze di Figaro," and " Romeo e Giulietta "-Malibran playing the hero in the latter opera. The following year Sontag also sang with
Malibran in London, her greatest success being in
Carolina, the principal character of Cimarosa's
" Il Matrimonio Segreto."
Mlle. Sontag was now for the first time assailed by the voice of calumny. Her union with
Count Rossi, consummated more than a year before, had been kept secret on account of the dislike of his family to the match. Born in Corsica,
Count Rossi was a near relative of the family of
Napoleon Bonaparte, and his sister was the Princess de Salm. His relations were opposed to his
marriage with one whom they considered a plebeian, though she had been ennobled by the
Prussian King, under the name of Von Lauenstein,
with a full patent and all the formalities observed
on such occasions. Mlle. Sontag determined to
make a farewell tour through Europe, and retire from the stage. She paid her adieux to her
public in the different great cities of Europe
