rival.
Lord Mount Edgcumbe, in his " Musical Reminiscences," speaks of Sophie Arnould, whom he
heard in ante-revolutionary days, as a woman of
entrancing beauty and very great dramatic genius.
This connoisseur tells us too that her voice, though
limited in range and not very flexible, was singularly rich, strong, and sweet, fitting her exceptionally for the performance of the simple and noble
arias of Gluck, which were rather characterized by
elevation and dramatic warmth than florid ornamentation. Her place in art is, therefore, as the
finest contemporary interpreter of Wagner's greater predecessor.
