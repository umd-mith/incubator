ELIZABETH BILLINGTON.

105

Elizabeth Schmaling's personal appearance was
far from striking. She was by no means handsome, being short and insignificant, with a rather
agreeable, good-natured countenance, the leading
feature of which was-terrible defect in a singer
-a set of irregular teeth, which projected, in defiance of order, out of their proper places. Her
manner, however, was prepossessing, though she
was an indifferent actress. But her voice atoned
for everything: its compass was from G to E in
altissimo, which she ran with the greatest ease
and force, the tones being at once powerful and
sweet. Both her portamento di voce and her volubility were declared to be unrivaled. It was remarked that she seemed to take difficult music
from choice, and she could sing fluently at sight
-rather a rare accomplishment among vocalists
of that day. Nothing taxed her powers. Her
execution was easy and neat; her shake was true,
open, and liquid; and though she preferred brilliant, effective pieces, her refined taste was well
known. "Her voice, clear, sweet, and distinct,
was sufficiently powerful," remarked Lord Mount
Edgcumbe afterward, "though rather thin, and
its agility and flexibility rendered her a most excellent bravura singer, in which style she was unrivaled."  "Mara's divisions," observes another
critic, " always seemed to convey a meaning; they
were vocal, not instrumental; they had light and
shade, and variety of tone."
