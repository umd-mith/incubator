excited by the hopes and fears, breathing the life
and spirit of the being she represents." Mine.
Pasta was a slow reader, but she had in perfection
the sense for the measurement and proportion of
time, a most essential musical quality. This gave
her an instinctive feeling for propriety, which no
lessons could teach; that due recognition of accent and phrase, that absence of flurry and exaggeration, such as makes the discourse and behavior
of some people memorable, apart from the value
of matter and occasion; that intelligent composure, without coldness, which impresses and
reassures those who see and hear. A quotation
from a distinguished critic already cited gives a
vivid idea of Pasta's influence on the most cold
and fastidious judges:
" The greatest grace of all, depth and reality
of expression, was possessed by this remarkable
artist as few (I suspect) before her-as none
whom I have since admired-have possessed it.
The best of her audience were held in thrall,
without being able to analyze what made up the
spell, what produced the effect,, so soon as she
opened her lips. Her recitative, from the moment
she entered, was riveting by its truth. People
accustomed to object to the conventionalities of
opera (just as loudly as if all drama was not conventional too), forgave the singing and the strange
language for the sake of the direct and dignified
appeal made by her declamation. Mine. Pasta
