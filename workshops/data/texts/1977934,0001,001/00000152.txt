production of pure tone from the chest, and inconsistent with a legitimate execution. This extreme motion was also visible during the shake,
which Catalani used sparingly, however, and with
little effect."
In spite of the reputation for rapacity which
the avarice and arrogance of her husband helped
to create, Catalani won golden opinions by her
sweet temper, liberality, and benevolence.  Her
purse-strings were always opened to relieve want
or encourage struggling merit. Her gayety and
light-heartedness were proverbial. It is recorded
that at Bangor once she heard for the first time
the strains of a Welsh harp, the player being a
poor blind itinerant. The music sounding in the
kitchen of the inn filled the world - renowned
singer with an almost infantile glee, and, rushing
in among the pots and pans, she danced as madly
as if she had been bitten by the tarantula, till, all
panting and breathless, she threw the harper two
guineas, and said she had never heard anything
which gave her more delight. The claims on her
purse kept pace with the enormous gains which
seemed to increase from year to year. To her
large charities and her extravagant habits of
living, her husband added the heavy losses to
which his passion for the gaming table led him.
It was said in after years that Mme. Catalani
should have been worth not less than half a million sterling, so immense had been her gains.
