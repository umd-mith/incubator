GREAT SINGERS.

live chimney-sweeps, who swing suspended and
smothered in rags. The accidents which happen
are sometimes tragical, sometimes farcical. When
the ropes break, then infernal spirits and immortal deities fall together, laming and sometimes
killing each other. Add to all this the monsters
which render some scenes very pathetic, such as
dragons, lizards, tortoises, and large toads, which
promenade the theatre with a menacing air, and
display at the opera all the temptations of St.
Anthony. Each of these figures is animated by
a lout of a Savoyard, who has not even intelligence enough to play the beast." Saint Preux is
also made to say of the singers    " One sees actresses nearly in convulsions, tearing yelps and
howls violently out of their lungs, closed hands
pressed on their breasts, heads thrown back, faces
inflamed, veins swollen, and stomach panting. I
know not which of the two, eye or ear, is more
agreeably affected by this display.... For my
part, I am certain that people applaud the outcries
of an actress at the opera as they would the feats
of a tumbler or rope-dancer at a fair.... Imagine this style of singing employed to express
the delicate gallantry and tenderness of Quinault.
Imagine the Muses, the Graces, the Loves, Venus
herself, expressing themselves this way, and judge
the effect. As for devils, it might pass, for this
music has something infernal in it, and is not ill
adapted to such beings."
