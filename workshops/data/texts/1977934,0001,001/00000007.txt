NOTE.
IN compiling and arranging the material which
enters into the following sketches of distinguished
singers, it is only honest to disclaim any originality except such as may be involved in a picturesque presentation of facts. The compiler has
drawn freely from a great variety of sources, and
has been simply guided by the desire to give the
reading public such a digest of the more important incidents in the careers of the celebrities
treated of as should be at once compact, racy,
and accurate. To serve this purpose the opinions
and descriptions of writers and critics contemporary with the subjects have been used at length,
and no means overlooked to give the sketches
that atmosphere of freshness which is the outcome of personal observation. All that a compilation of this kind can hope to effect is best
gained in preserving this kind of vividness, instead of revamping impressions and opinions into
second-hand forms.    Pains have been taken to
verify dates and facts, and it is believed they will
be found trustworthy.
