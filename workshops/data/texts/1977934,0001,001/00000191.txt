GIUDITTA PASTA.

185

Pasta never employs them but to heighten the
force of the expression; and, what is more, her
embellishments last only just so long as they are
found to be useful." In this respect her manner formed a very strong contrast with that of
the generality of Italian singers at the time, who
were more desirous of creating astonishment than
of giving pleasure. It was not from any lack of
technical knowledge and vocal skill that Mme.
Pasta avoided extravagant ornamentation, for in
many of the concerted pieces-in which she chiefly
shone-her execution united clearness and rapidity. "MMme. Pasta is certainly less exuberant in
point of ornament, and more expressive in point
of majesty and simplicity," observed one critic,
" than any of the first-class singers who have visited England for a long period.... She is also a
mistress of art," continues the same writer, " and,
being limited by nature, she makes no extravagant use of her powers, but employs them with
the tact and judgment that can proceed only from
an extraordinary mind. This constitutes her highest praise; for never did intellect and industry
become such perfect substitutes for organic superiority. Notwithstanding her fine vein of imagination and the beauty of her execution, she cultivates high and deep passions, and is never so
great as in the adaptation of art to the purest
purposes of expression."
