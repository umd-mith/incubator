the stage, and was received by the King and
Queen with the heartiest kindness and a profusion
of costly gifts. A similar reception at Venice
tempted her to prolong her Italian tour, but she
preferred to return to London, where she sang
under Wyatt at the Pantheon, which was transformed into a temporary opera-house. She now
sang with Pacchierotti, the successor of Farinelli
and Caffarelli, and the last inheritor of their
grand large style. " His duettos with Mara were
the most perfect pieces of execution I ever
heard," said Lord Mount Edgcumbe. One of the
most pathetic experiences of Mara's life was her
passage through Paris in 1792 on her way to Germany, when she saw her former patroness Marie
Antoinette, whom she remembered in all the glory
of her youth, popularity, and loveliness, seated
in an open chariot, pale, wan, and grief-stricken,
surrounded by a guard of troopers with drawn
swords and hooted at by a mob of howling sansculottes. Better far to be a mimib queen than to
be hurled from the most radiant and splendid
place in European royalty, to be the scorn and
plaything of the ragged ruffians of Paris, and to
finish with the guillotine in the Place de la GrBve!
About this time she was freed from the bete noire
of her life, her drunken worthless husband, who
agreed to trouble her no more if she would settle
an annuity on him. Thenceforward they never
met, though she always spoke of him with affection.
