fully, showing a drawerful of splendid boxes, that
the worst was finer than the French King's present. " If he had only sent me his portrait in it,"
said the vain artist. " That is only given to ambassadors and princes," was the reply of the King's
gentleman. " Well," was the reply, " all the ambassadors and princes in the world would not
make one Caffarelli." The King laughed heartily
at this, but the Dauphin sent for the singer and presented him with a passport, saying, " It is signed
by the King himself-for you a great honor;
but lose no time in using it, for it is only good
for ten days." Caffarelli left in high dudgeon,
saying he had not made his expenses in France.
Mr. Garrick, the great actor, heard Caffarelli
in Naples in 1764, when he was turned of sixty,
and thus writes to Dr. Burney: " Yesterday we
attended the ceremony of making a nun; she was
the daughter of a duke, and everything was conducted with great splendor and magnificence.
The consecration was performed with great solemnity, and I was very much affected; and, to
crown the whole, the principal part was sung by
the famous Caffarelli, who, though old, has pleased
me more than all the singers I ever heard. He
touched me, and it is the first time I have been
touched since I came to Italy." At this time
Caffarelli had accumulated a great fortune, purchased a dukedom, and built a splendid palace at
San Dorato, from which he derived his ducal title.
