ferent parts of Europe, but always with declining
prestige. In the London "Daily Post" of September 7, 1741, appeared a paragraph which startled her old admirers: " We hear from Italy that
the famous singer, Mrs. C-z-ni, is under sentence
of death, to be beheaded for poisoning her husband." If this -was so, the sentence was never
carried into execution, for she sang seven years
afterward in London at a benefit concert. She
issued a preliminary advertisement, avouching her
"pressing debts" and her "desire to pay them"
as the reason for her asking the benefit, which,
she declared, should be the last she would ever
trouble the public with. Old, poor, and almost
deprived of her voice by her infirmities, her attempt to revive the interest of the public in her
favor was a miserable failure; her star was set
for ever, and she was obliged to return to Holland
more wretched than she came. She had scarcely
reappeared there when she was again thrown into
prison for debt; but, by entering into an agreement to sing at the theatre every night, under
surveillance, she was enabled to obtain her release.
Her recklessness and improvidence had brought
her to a pitiable condition; and in her latter days,
after a career of splendor, caprice, and extravagance, she was obliged to subsist, it is said, by
button-making. She died in frightful indigence,
the recipient of charity, at a hospital in Bologna,
in 1770.
