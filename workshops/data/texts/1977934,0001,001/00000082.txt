GREAT SINGERS.

the most dangerous enemies of the Napoleonic
government in France. The Count's Piedmontese
valet had been bribed by a spy of Fouch6, the
French Minister of Police, to purloin certain papers.  The valet was discovered by his master,
and instantly stabbed him, and, as the Countess
entered the room a moment afterward, he also
pierced her heart with the stiletto reeking with
her husband's blood, finishing the shocking tragedy by blowing out his own brains. Thus died,
in 1812, one who had been among the most brilliant ornaments of the French stage.
No record of Sophie Arnould's artistic associates is complete without some allusion to the
celebrated dancers Gaitan Vestris * and Auguste,
his son. Gaitan was accustomed to say that there
were three great men in Europe-Voltaire, Frederick the Great, and himself. In his old age he
preserved all his skill, and M. Castel Blaze, who
saw him at the Acahmie fifty years after his
debut in 1748, declares that he still danced with
inimitable grace. It is of Gaitan that the story
is told in connection with Gluck, when the opera
of "Orph6e" was put in rehearsal. The dancer
wished for a ballet in the opera.
"Write me the music of a chacone, Monsieur
Gluck," said the god of dancing.
* Mme. Vestris, the last of the family, and the first wife
of the English comedian Charles Mathews, was the granddaughter of Gaitan.
