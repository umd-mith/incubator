concert at Hamburg; and it was here that she
took the occasion at a great banquet given her
by a wealthy merchant to make the public and
formal announcement of her marriage to Count
Rossi. It was remarked that during this farewell
concert tour her powers, far from having declined,
seemed to have gained in compass, brilliancy, and
expression.
Countess Rossi first lived at the Hague, and
then for a short time at Frankfort. Here she
took precedence of all the ladies of the diplomatic
corps, her husband being Minister Plenipotentiary
to the Germanic Diet. In Berlin she was a familiar guest of the royal family, and sang duets and
trios with the princes and princesses. She devoted
her leisure hours to the study of composition, and
at the houses of Prince Esterhazy and Prince Metternich, in 1841, at Vienna, she executed a cantata of her own for soprano and chorus with most
brilliant success. The Empress herself invited the
Countess to repeat it at her own palace with all

and flattered, possessed of ample wealth and rank,
idolized by her friends and respected by the great
world, Henrietta Sontag passed nearly twenty
swift, happy years at the different European cap
