with this siren, has an amusing apology for her
carelessness of her duties in England, which he
insists was not caprice, but inability to sing. He
says: "And this I can readily believe, for that

rapidity and neatness through the most minute
divisions, and produces almost instantaneously so
great a variety of modulation, must surely depend
on the very nicest tones of the fibers; and if these
