GREAT SINGERS.

" Contretemps, or The Rival Queens," which was
performed at Heidigger's theatre. Faustina as the
Queen of Bologna and Cuzzoni as Princess of
Miodena were made to seize each other by the
hair, and   lacerate each other's faces.    Handel
looks on with cynical attention, and calmly orders
that the antagonists be "left to fight it out, inasmuch as the only way to calm their fury is to let
them satisfy it."
The directors of the opera finally solved the
difficulty in the following manner: Cuzzoni had
solemnly sworn never to accept a guinea less than
her rival. As Faustina was far more attractive
and manageable, she was offered just one guinea
more than Cuzzoni, who learning the fact broke
her contract in a fury of indignation, and accepted
a Viennese engagement. The well-known Ambrose Philips addressed the following farewell lines
to the wrathful singer:
"Little siren of the stage,
Charmer of an idle age,
Empty warbler, breathing lyre,
Wanton gale of fond desire;
Bane of every manly art,
Sweet enfeebler of the heart;
Oh! too pleasing is thy strain.
Hence to southern climes again,
Tuneful mischief, vocal spell;
To this island bid farewell:
Leave us as we ought to beLeave the Britons rough and free."
