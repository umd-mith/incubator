rustic as easily as she identifies herself with.Medea, Semiramide, Tancredi, and Anna Bolena."
IV.
AFTER an absence of three years Mme. Pasta
returned to England, and her opening performance
of Medea was aided by the talents of Rubini,
Lablache, and Fanny Ayton. Rubini performed
the character of Egeus, and the duets between
the king of tenors and Pasta were so remarkable
in a musical sense as to rival the dramatic impression made by her great acting. She was no
exception to the rule that very great tragic actors
are rarely devoid of a strong comic individuality.
In Erreco's "Prova d'un Opera Seria," an opera
caricaturing the rehearsals of a serious opera at
the house of the prima donna and at the theatre,
her performance was so arch, whimsical, playful,
and capricious, that its drollery kept the audience
in a roar of laughter, while Lablache, as "the
composer," seconded her humor by that talent for
comedy which Ronconi alone has ever approached.
Lablache also appeared with Pasta in "Anna
Bolena," and the great basso, mighty in bulk,
mighty in voice, and mighty in genius, fairly
startled the public by his extraordinary resemblance to Holbein's portrait of Henry VIII.
After singing a farewell engagement in Paris, Mme. Pasta went to Milan to enjoy the last
great triumph of her life in 1832 at La Scala.
