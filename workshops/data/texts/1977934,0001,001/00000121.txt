in spite of the personal bitterness growing out of
her own irritable temper and professional rivalry,
she remained a great artistic favorite with the
public.  Underneath the asperity and obstinacy
of her character there was a vein of deep tenderness and generosity, which she showed in various
cases, especially in forwarding the interests of
struggling artists. Michael Kelly, the Irish composer, in his "Reminiscences," gives the following
instance.  He himself, then a young man, had
aroused Mara's dislike by some inadvertent praise
of a rival. Watching his opportunity, he brought
into the greenroom one night, when she came off
the stage fatigued and panting with her efforts, a
pot of foaming porter, which she drank with a
sigh of deepest pleasure. Touched by the young
Irishman's thoughtfulness, she pledged herself to
help him whenever the opportunity came, and
soon after sang at his benefit. Mara had resolved
not to sing again on the lyric stage, and her condescension was a godsend to Kelly, who was then
very much out at elbows. Speaking of her proffer, he says: "I was thunderstruck at her kindness and liberality, and thankfully accepted. She
fixed on M]andane in 'Artaxerxes,' and brought
the greatest receipts ever known at that house, as
the whole pit, with the exception of two benches,
was railed into boxes.   So much," he adds sententiously, "for a little German proficiency, a
little common civility, and a pot of porter."
