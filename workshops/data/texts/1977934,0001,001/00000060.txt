GREAT SINGERS.

paid her a visit one day, and tore one of his ruffles
by catching in some part of her dress. Gabrielli
the next day, to make amends, sent him six bottles
of Spanish wine, with the costliest rolls of Flanders
lace stuffed into the mouths of the bottles instead
of corks. But, if she was extravagant and luxurious, she was also generous; and, in spite of the
cruel caprices which had marked-her life, she always gave tokens of a naturally kind heart. She
gave largely to charity, and provided liberally for
her parents, as also for her brother's education.
Of this brother, who appeared at the Teatro Argentina in Rome as a tenor, but who sang as
wretchedly as his sister did exquisitely, an amusing anecdote is narrated. The audience began
to hoot and hiss, and yells of "Get out, you
raven! " sounded through the house. With great
sang-froid the unlucky singer said: "You fancy
you are mortifying me by booting me; you are
grossly deceived; on the contrary, I applaud
your judgment, for I solemnly declare that I never
appear on any stage without receiving the same
treatment, and sometimes worse."
Gabrielli's closing years were spent at Bologna,
where she won the esteem and admiration of all
by her charities and steadiness of life, a notable
contrast to the license and extravagance of her
earlier career. She died in 1796, at the age of
sixty-six.
