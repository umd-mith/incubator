cayed grandeur with a cynical and bitter sneer on
her face, drawing the attention of the theatre by
her exhibition of satirical malevolence.
Malibran's great sister, Mme. Pauline Viardot, was also present, watching with the quick,
sympathetic response of a noble heart every turn
of the singer's voice and action. Hoarse, broken,
and destroyed as was the voice, her grand style
spoke to the sensibilities of the great artist. The
opera was "Anna Bolena," and from time to

and gestures. In the final mad scene Pasta rallied into something like her former grandeur
of acting; and in the last song with its roulades
and its scales of shakes ascending by a semitone, this consummate vocalist and tragedienne,
able to combine form with meaning-dramatic
grasp and insight with such musical display as
enter into the lyric art-was indicated at least to
the apprehension of the younger artist. "You
are right! " was Mme. Viardot's quick and heartfelt response to a friend by her side, while her
eyes streamed with tears-" you are right. It is
like the 'Cenacolo' of Leonardo da Vinci at Milan, a wreck of a picture, but the picture is the
greatest picture in the world."
