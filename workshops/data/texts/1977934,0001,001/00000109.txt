him, it was enough for him to hear the report,
"She sings like a German," to make him     sniff
with disdain. " A German singer!" he said; " I

send for Mile. Schmiling, who was enthusiastically praised by many of those whose opinions the
King could not ignore, to come to Potsdam and
sing for him. Her pride, which was high, had
been wounded by the royal criticism, and she carried herself with as much hauteur as could go
with respect. The King regarded her with a cool
stare, without any gesture of salutation, and Mlle.
Schmaling amused herself with looking at the
pictures. "So you are going to sing me something? " at last said royalty with military abruptness.
The figure of the Prussian King as he sat by
the piano was anything but prepossessing.    A
little, crabbed, spare old man, attired with Spartan simplicity, in a faded blue coat, whose red
facings were smudged brown with the Spanish
snuff he so liberally took; thin lips, prominent
jaws, receding forehead, and eyes of supernatural
keenness glaring from under shaggy brows; a
battered cocked hat, and a thick cane, which he
used as a whip to belabor his horse, his courtiers,
or his soldiers as occasion needed, on the table
before him-all these made a grim picture.
