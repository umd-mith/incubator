GREAT -SINGERS.

Mile. Schmahing answered his curt words with
"As your Majesty pleases," and instantly sat
down at the piano. As she sang, Frederick's face
relaxed, and taking a huge pinch of snuff, he said,
" Ha! can you sing at sight? " (then an extraordinary accomplishment). Picking out the most
difficult bravura in his collection, he bade her try
it, with the remark, "This, to be sure, is but
poor stuff, but when well executed sounds pretty
enough." The result of the royal examination
convinced the King that Mlle. Schmaling had not
only a magnificent voice, but was a thorough
artist. So the daughter of the poor musician of
Cassel, after many years of hard struggle and ill
success (for she had sung in almost every German
capital), was made Frederick's chief court singer
at the age of twenty-two, and the road to fortune
was fairly open to her. At the age of four years
she had showed such aptitude for music that she
quickly learned the violin, though her baby fingers
could hardly span the strings. She always retained
her predilection for this instrument, and maintained that it was the best guide in learning to
sing. "For," said she, "how can you best convey a just notion of slight vibrations in the pitch
of a note? By a fixed instrument? No! By
the voice? No! But, by sliding the finger on the
string, you instantly make the most minute variation visibly as well as audibly perceptible." She
owed her success entirely to the charm of her art.
