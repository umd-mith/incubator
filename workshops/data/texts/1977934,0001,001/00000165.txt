ANGELICA CATALANI.

George IV., then Prince of Wales, who had a
manuscript score of the work, with instrumental
parts, sent to him as a gift by the great Haydn
several years before, as a memorial of the kindness shown by the Prince to the composer of the
"Creation," when in London conducting the celebrated Salaman symphonic concerts. The characters of Vittellic and Cesto were splendidly performed by the two singers; but the Italian part
of the company did not perform the difficult and
exacting music con amore, neither were the audiences of that day trained up to the appreciation
of the glorious music of Mozart which has obtained since that time.
Braham's career as a singer of English opera
is that with which his glory in art is chiefly associated. His first appearance was in a somewhat
feeble work called the " Chains of the Heart," and
this was succeeded by the " Cabinet," a production in which Braham composed all the music of
his own part, both solo and the concerted portions
in which he had to appear-a custom which he
continued for a number of years. Seldom has
music been more popular than that in which Braham appeared, for he knew how to suit all the
subtile qualities of his own voice. Among the
more celebrated operas in which he appeared, now
unknown except by tradition, may be mentioned
"Family Quarrels," "Thirty Thousand," "English Fleet," "Out of Place," "False Alarms,"
