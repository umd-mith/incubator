of their reputation-both brilliant singers, but
destined to pale into insignificance afterward before the intense splendor of Pasta's perfected genius. One of the notices of the opening performance at the King's Theatre, when Mme. Camporese sang the leading role of Cimarosa's "Penelope," followed up a lavish eulogium on the prima
donna with the contemptuous remark, "Two subordinate singers named Pasta and Mari came forward in the characters of Telamuco and Arsinod, but their musical talent does not require minute delineation." There is every reason to believe that Pasta was openly flouted both by the
critics and the members of her own profession
during her first London experience, but a magnificent revenge was in store for her. Among
the parts she sang at this chrysalis period were
Cherubino in the "Nozze di Figaro," Servilia in
"La Clemenza di Tito," and the role of the pretended shrew in Ferrari's "I1 Sbaglio Fortunato."
Mme. Pasta found herself at the end of the
season a dire failure. But she had the searching
self-insight which stamps the highest forms of
genius, and she determined to correct her faults,
and develop her great but latent powers. Suddenly she disappeared from the view of the operatic world, and buried herself in a retired Italian
city, where she studied with intelligent and tireless zeal under M. Scappa, a maestro noted for his
power of kindling the material of genius.   Oc
