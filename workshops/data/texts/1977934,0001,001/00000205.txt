at the theatre. A distinguished traveler relates
having heard her sing the grand aria of the Queen
of the Night in the " Zauberfl6te" at this age, " her
arms hanging beside her and her eye following
the flight of a butterfly, while her voice, pure, penetrating, and of angelic tone, flowed as unconsciously as a limpid rill from the mountain-side." The
year after this Henrietta lost her father, and she
went to Prague with her mother, where she played
children's parts under Weber, then chef d'orchestre. When she had attained the proper age she
was admitted to the Prague Conservatory, and
spent four years studying vocalization, the piano,
and the elements of harmony. An accident gave
the young singer the chance for a dcbut in the
sudden illness of the prima donna, who was cast
to sing the part of the Princesse de Navarre in
Boieldieu's "Jean de Paris." The little vocalist of
fifteen had to wear heels four inches high, but she
sang none the less well, and the audience seemed
to feel that they had heard a prodigy. She also
took the part of the heroine in Paer's opera of
"Sargino," and her brilliant success decided hei
career, as she was invited to take a position in
the Viennese Opera. Here she met the brilliant
Mme. Fodor, then singing an engagement in the
Austrian capital. So great was this distinguished
singer's admiration of the young girl's talents
that she said, " Had I her voice I should hold the
whole world at my feet."
