GREAT SINGERS.

Barthe, author of "Les Fausses Infidelites," and
many similar pieces. He was inflated with vanity, though he was totally ignorant of everything
away from the theatre, and was, in fact, one of
those individuals who actually seem    to court
mystification and practical jokes. Mlle. Arnould
instructed her servant Jeannot, and had him announced pompously under the title of the Chevalier de Medicis, giving M. Barthe to understand
that the young man was an illegitimate son of the
house of Medici. The pretended nobleman appeared to be treated with respect and distinction
by the company, and he spoke to the poet with
much affability, professing great admiration for
his works. M. Barthe was enchanted. He was
in a flutter of gratified vanity, and, to show his
delight at the condescension of the chevalier, he
proposed to write an epic poem in honor of his
house.   This farce lasted during the evening.
The assembled company were in convulsions of
suppressed laughter, which broke out when, at
the moment of M. Barthe's most ecstatic admiration and respect for his new patron, Sophie Arnould lifted her glass, and, looking at the chevalier, said, in a clear voice, " Your health, Jeannot! "  The sensations of poor M. Barthe may
readily be imagined. The incident became the
story of the day in all circles, and the unlucky
poet could not go anywhere for fear of being
tormented about " Jeannot."
