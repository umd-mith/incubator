GREAT SINGERS.

first appearance in Paris in a small part in Gluck's
"Armide." Small, thin, and unprepossessing in
person, her power of expression and artistic vocalism won more and more on the public, till the retirement of Sophie Arnould and Mlle. Levasseur,
and the death of Laguerre, left her in undisputed
possession of the stage. When Piccini's " Didon,"
his greatest opera,* was produced, she sang the
part of the Queen of Carthage. Marmontel, the
poet of the opera, had already said at rehearsal,
" She expressed it so well that I imagined myself
at the theatre," and Piccini congratulated her on
having been largely instrumental in its success.
As Didon she made one of her greatest successes.
" Never," says Grimm, "has there been united
acting more captivating, a sensibility more per* " Didon," differing widely from the other operas of Piccini, was modeled after the new operatic principles of Gluck,
and was a magnificent homage on the part of his old rival to
the genius of the German. Indeed, although the adherents of
the two musicians waged so fierce a conflict, they themselves
were full of respect and admiration for each other. Gluck
always warmly expressed his appreciation of Piccini's " felicitous and charming melodies, the clearness of his style, the
elegance and truth of his expression." What Piccini's opinion
of Gluck was is best shown in his proposition after Gluck's
death to raise a subscription, not for the erection of a statue,
but for the establishment of an annual concert to take place on
the anniversary of Gluck's death, to consist entirely of his compositions-" in order to transmit to posterity the spirit and
character of his magnificent works, that they may serve as a
model to future artists of the true style of dramatic music."
