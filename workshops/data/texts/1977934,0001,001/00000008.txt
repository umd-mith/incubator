NOTE.

It will be observed that many well-known
singers have been omitted, or treated only incidentally: among the earlier singers, such as Anastasia Robinson, Mingotti, Anna Maria Crouch,
and Anna Selina Storace; among more recent
ones, such as Mmes. Fodor, Cinti-Damoreau, Camperese, Pisaroni, Miss Catherine Stephens, Mrs.
Paton-Wood, Mme. Dorus-Gras, and Cornelie
Falcon. This omission has been indispensable in
a work whose purpose has been to cover only the
lives of the very great names in operatic art, as
the question of limit has been inflexible. A supplementary volume will give similar sketches of
later celebrities.
The works from which material has been most
freely drawn are as follows: Bernard's " Retrospection of the Stage"; Dr. Burney's various
histories of music; Chorley's " Thirty Years'
Musical Recollections "; Dibdin's " Complete
History of the English Stage "; Ebers's " Seven
Years of the King's Theatre"; F6tis's " Biographie des Musiciens"; Hogarth's "Musical
Drama"; Sutherland Edwards's " History of the
Opera "; ArsEne Houssaye's " Galerie des Portraits"; Michael Kelly's " Reminiscences"; Lord
Mount Edgcumbe's "Musical Reminiscences";
Oxberry's "Dramatic Biography and Histrionic
Anecdotes "; Mrs. Clayton's "Queens of Song";
Arthur Simpson's " Memoirs of Catalani"; and
Grove's "Dictionary of Music and Musicians."
