Hydrocyanic acid we have seen give at least temporary
relief in a few cases where there was great prostration and
oppression of the chest. One poor woman, a sober, respectable person, who had been ill for twelve hours when we
saw her, and complained much of excessive uneasiness at
the heart, exclaimed after a few doses of hydrocyanic acid,
"God be thanked, my breast is getting benefit," and for
some time there was decided improvement both in her sensations and appearance. On the whole, however, we believe
that the number of cases in which it is indicated, will not
be found large; perhaps the particular period suited for its
administration is very short.
