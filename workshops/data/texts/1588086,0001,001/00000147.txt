ITS PATHOLOGY-EXCITING CAUSES.

Dr. Adair Crawford confirms the statement:
" Many observations prove that a damp state of the atmosphere is one of the circumstances the most favourable to
the development of the disease. This is the general condition of the air along rivers and lakes, where the banks are
often marshy, and covered with mist. In 1831, when the
cholera broke out in the Polish army, while contending with
the Russians on the banks of the Vistula, it was observed,
(as reported to me by Dr. Dalmas, who had been sent to
Poland by the French Government to study the disease,)
that whenever the Polish army occupied low and marshy
positions along the river, there was immediately a rapid increase of the cholera among the troops, and that each time
they removed to higher ground the disease immediately decreased."
It were easy to give more instances of a similiar kind, but
it would serve no purpose; it is enough to say that a humid
state of the atmosphere has frequently been observed to attend the epidemic cholera, but that it is not essential to the
production of the disease. The evil effects of a humid locality in increasing the risk of cholera have been established
by the history of the epidemic in its whole course. To begin with India,"Seringapatam is one of those noxious spots so devoted
to fever, that they should be shunned by man as a residence
if he is unable to remove the cause.  It lies in a basin,
formed on all sides by hills, and is surrounded to a considerable distance by rice-fields, watered from canals drawn from
the Cauvery, and carried off at considerable angles from the
river along the sides of the neighbouring heights.  The
ground between them and the parent stream is formed into
a succession of terraces, and thus kept continually overflowed
whilst the grain is growing, but suffered to dry up for its
