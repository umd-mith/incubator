acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23d instant,
with the reports of cases of cholera forwarded therewith;
and I am to convey the thanks of the Board to the Physicians
of the Edinburgh HIomoeopathic Dispensary, for the valuable information contained in those Reports.-I am, Sir, your
most obedient Servant,
ALEX. BAIN, Asst. Secretary.
To G. ATKIN, Esq., M.D.,
Homoeopathic Dispensary, 5, James' Square, Edinburgh.
Although, as we before said, the cholera appeared about
the beginning of October, it was not till the ] 8th that there
was a daily report of the number of cases sent to London.
The disease, although it still exists among us, and has
broken out in a neighbouring village with great virulence,
may be said to have ceased as an epidemic by the end of
December: so that its course is included in the months of
October, November, and December. The following tables
show, first, the weather of these three months in the year
1847 when there was no cholera, then the weather of the
three months of 1848 when the cholera prevailed, and the
number of cases each day from the 18th of October to the
1st of January 1849. We are indebted to Mr. Adie, the
distinguished optician, the well-known inventor of the Symphisometer, for the weather tables, and the most perfect reliance may be placed on their accuracy; and we are indebted
to Mr. Bain, Secretary to the Board of Health, for the daily
returns of cases of cholera.  We shall not attempt to draw
any conclusions whatever from this table, but publish it in
the hope that similar records may be kept in all places
where cholera prevails. We should advise that in addition
to the particulars we have given of the weather, the dewpoint should be noted, and also the state of the atmospheric
electricity.
