ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


delphia, upon the effects of the poisons of the lachesis and
crotalus, the chief sources of our knowledge upon this subject are the writings of the Abbe Fontana and Dr. Mead, on
the Viper, and Russell's Indian Serpents. The most interesting facts disclosed by their investigation, as far as concerns our present subject, are, that the deadly effects are
more certain and rapid in warm countries, and warm weather,
than in cold, that the poison seems to act directly on the
nerves of organic life, and afterwards affects the blood, and
that many of the symptoms bear a close resemblance to those
of cholera. The following quotation from Fontana will, we

than to find substances which, when applied to one part of
the animal machine, act as a remedy; instead of which they

Several medicines, particularly in the class of poisons, operate precisely in this way; fresh examples of which will be
given in the continuation of this work.
" Electricity occasions death by depriving the heart and

work on Animal Physics; and this same electricity is notwithstanding one of the strongest stimulants to the muscular
fibres that is known. It restores life by exciting irritability in the very animals in which it had an instant before

" In the second place, the application of fixed air has a

when it is respired. In the first case its action is ilnmme
