ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


and we may add that a derangement in the weight, heat,
and electric condition of the air have been frequently
observed to attend an outbreak of the disease. Unwholesome food may also perhaps be mentioned among its existing causes.
That cholera is produced by a specific poison is generally admitted by writers upon the subject. As to the essential nature of this specific miasm we are entirely ignorant;
and we do not think it would serve any useful purpose
to enter into a discussion upon the various hypotheses which
have been proposed. For the most part the explanation
offered to account for the mode of action of any one miasm
will not cover the whole question; and this, in our opinion,
is a fatal objection, for it is obvious that they present but
one problem; and the true solution, when it comes, will
explain all the varieties of the phenomenon.
The telluric origin of this poison seems clearly indicated by
the sudden way it breaks out in various places at the same
time, and its continuance in some situations; resembling in
this particular the malaria from the Pontine marshes, the
campagna of Rome, or from the unwholesome ground in the
neighbourhood of some volcanoes, as for instance the country
about Psestum.
-The connexion of the morbid emanation with the earth
is further proved by the curious fact that there is no instance on record of a ship from Europe having a single case of
this disease' on board until it has had communication with
the shore.*
As to its being reproduced by those affected by it-this
is equivalent to its propagation by contagion, at least the
latter proposition almost necessarily involves the former.
