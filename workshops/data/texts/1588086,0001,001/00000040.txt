INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.


man records, coeval with the Pyramids, there is preserved an
epitome of the future history of great epidemics, which devastated nearly the whole earth; and so far from divesting
the wonders in the land of Egypt of their Divine significance
and strictly miraculous character, it seems to us that by viewing these successive events as produced by the ordinary laws
of nature, and converted into direct judgments by having been

fullest sense, by all mankind, were it possible, could alone
avert, by making unnecessary, those fatal, ever new epidemics which have so often scourged our race.    In the
