ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


seized with it, in consequence of which several of them
died. Three men, having eaten, at the same time, the seeds
of the coral plant, had all the symptoms of severe cholera."
So much for the predisposing and exciting causes of the
disease. We have spoken only of the more prominent and
unquestionable; to have attempted more would have required
greater space than is consistent with the design of this
treatise. We now pass to a consideration of
THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF CHOLERA.
Suppose a labouring man returns home of a dull, drizzly
evening after his day's hard work, and instead of finding his
supper ready for him, finds his room in an uproar, and his
wife ill of cholera: suppose that after giving his assistance
all night till she dies, he lies down without eating anything,
exhausted and distressed, upon some straw beside her bed,
which is on the level with the floor, we should then have a
combination of the predisposing and exciting causes of the
disease: and suppose he suddenly manifested the characteristic symptoms of the disease, and we were asked to tell
the nature and seat of the first change in his system which
had so suddenly transformed a strong, healthy man into a
shrivelled, convulsed, speechless patient, more like a corpse
than a living being; the answer to such a question would
be an account of the proximate cause of the disease. It is
obvious that the discovery of this proximate cause, this internal change, is much more difficult than the determination
of the external exciting causes or the predisposing ones;
and while there is a general consent in regard to the latter,
there is a great diversity of opinion about the former. It is
not our intention to notice all the conjectural causes which
have been assumed and proposed to account for the symptoms of cholera, we shall only advert to two opinions upon
