ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


two cities. In reference to this interesting point, we may
quote a few sentences from a recent article in the British
Journal of Homoeopathy:
- "TThe only general observation upon this head we are
inclined to make, refers to the topography of Edinburgh as
compared with that of Glasgow. By universal admission,
the cholera has an affinity to water. While by some mysterious law of progression, it has moved by steady steps in all
kinds of weather, from extreme cold to great heat, against
high winds, over every variety of country, from an easterly
to a westerly direction, until it has now almost encircled the
globe, it has preferred the courses of rivers for its local
direction. In Scotland, it has moved up the Firth, the Clyde,
and the Tweed. The topography of Edinburgh is very peculiar. It may be described as composed of two deep narrow
valleys, one little better than a large ditch, and surrounding
heights. In the valleys, particularly in the narrowest and
deepest, are built old houses, very close together, and occupied by the poorest of the people, and the most dissipated:
it is called the Cowgate. The other valley is but partially
covered with houses; it runs between the ridge of the old
town and the new. These narrow valleys are bridged over.
The higher grounds are covered for the most part with newly
built houses. In the new town, which lies at the north side
of the second or wider valley, the houses are spacious and
scattered over a large space of ground. There is little or no
direct communication between the inhabitants of the new
-town and those of the worse parts of the old. There is a
moral as well as a physical gulf between them. The rich
pass over, not through the town of the poor. Hardly a case
of cholera appeared in the new town, its ravages were confined to the old town, especially the narrow valleys and the
houses covering their steep sloping sides.
