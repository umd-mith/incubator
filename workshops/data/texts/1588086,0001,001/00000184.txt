ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


injected with blood-vessels; in one, the nerve was enlarged;
in another, it was thickened; and in a third, the neurolema
was inflamed with ecchymosed patches.
" In six, the neurolema of the splanchnic nerves was vascular; in two, the ganglia at their origins were vividly injected; and one ganglion was ecchymosed.
" In sixteen, one or both of the semilunar ganglia were
vascular; in one, it was inflamed; in three, it was enlarged
and infiltrated with blood or serum; and in two softened.
" In eight, the solar plexus was highly vascular throughout; in three, the ganglia and nerves were enlarged, and
one infiltrated.
" In four, the renal plexus was very vascular.
" In four, the zesophageal plexuses were vascular.
" In one, the recurrent of the pneumogastric nerve was
vascular.
" In five, the cardiac plexus was enlarged and very vascular."*
Mr. Lizars is a most competent authority in anatomical
matters, although his observations require confirmation. We
shall conclude this department of our subject by a translation of Dr. Miiller's summary of the pathological appearances observed in the recent epidemic, and which are derived from upwards of six hundred dissections of cholera
subjects:Petersburgh, August 1848.
Membranes of the Brain.-Usually congested, but more
frequently cedenmatous: the vessels of the dura mater filled
with coagula of black unctuous blood; the dura mater at
the base of the skull almost completely black-blue, (from the
stagnation of the blood in all the vessels.) On removing
the brain, there generally gushed out a great quantity of
