ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


CHAPTER 1II.
ITS PATHOLOGY.
IN this Chapter we propose to discuss the predisposing,
exciting, and proximate causes, and morbid anatomy of
cholera; reserving for the sequel the consideration of the
symptoms or semeiology, as well as all that refers to the
treatment or therapeutics of the disease.
By " predisposing causes" we mean all those conditions
of the body, whether natural or acquired, which render it
peculiarly liable to the influence of the exciting causes of
the disease-as, for example, sex and starvation. By " exciting," all the causes external to the body which tend to
give rise to this peculiar morbid action within it, as the
state of the atmosphere, or intercourse with the infected;
and lastly, by "proximate cause," the morbid action itself,
which, if unchecked, necessarily goes on to produce all the
phenomena of the disease.
The proximate cause is the first in a series of morbid
actions. Without it there can be no cholera; but the subsequent changes in the system may or may not go on.
These secondary morbid actions, which are produced by the
first proximate cause, become themselves in their turn the
proximate cause of a second series of phenomena. As it
is of great consequence that we should have distinct ideas
on this subject, we shall quote a paragraph from Fletcher's
Pathology to the point:
