ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


or no discharge from the bowels at all, and that there is no
appearance of any of those symptoms we are in the habit of
seeing attendant upon bleeding to death. As an example,
let us mention a case which came under our own observation.
A healthy young man had been at his work till four o'clock
in the afternoon, when he returned home and went to bed
beside his father, (a poor old Frenchman, a follower of
Charles X. into Edinburgh.) We arrived at the house at
nine in the evening, and his father told us that his poor boy
had been perfectly well till that day, that he had been over
the bed ten minutes before, and was violently cramped. On
turning to the lad himself, we found him stiff and dead.
He had died convulsed in the bed with his father, without
his father knowing it, and had been able to get up and stand
ten minutes before his death. There is a multitude of similar cases on record, although we believe few so painful in
every particular. Mr. Scot* says, the absence of purging
appears to denote a peculiar degree of malignancy in the
attack. In short, in the worst kind of cholera, that peculiar
symptom of intestinal haemorrhage does not occur, therefore
flooding from the bowels cannot constitute the proximate
cause of the disease.
Our other objection is, that cholera may be cured as
rapidly as it makes its invasion, which is quite incompatible
with its being dependent upon violent hemorrhage. We
need give no farther illustration of this after the case of Dr.
Quin, to which we have already adverted.
We may then dismiss this cause as neither proved to exist,
nor sufficient, if it did, to produce the phenomena for which
it is called to account.
The other opinion of the proximate cause of cholera is,
that it is a morbid affection of the ganglionic system of
