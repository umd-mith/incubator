ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


instances we have seen sudden relapse follow upon eating;
and, in our opinion, it is of the greatest consequence to give
no food at all, nothing but cold water till the second and third

presence of mind and good sense of the individual practitioner. Each case has its peculiar features, and requires a
management of its own; and the most experienced and selfpossessed will often find himself embarrassed, and all his
