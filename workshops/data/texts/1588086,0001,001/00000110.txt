ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


Those who are the most unwilling to admit the contagiousness of cholera, allow its tendency to " localize" itself, as they
term it. That is, if cholera once gains access to a house,
then all the inmates of that house, and all who enter it,
become liable to be attacked by the disease. The fact is
undoubted, and we have seen many instances of it; sometimes after the lapse of two weeks the poison continued to
act upon a new comer. This naturally suggests the question,
Where does the poison dwell? The rooms are sometimes perfectly bare; not even are there bed-clothes to harbour the
deadly and subtle power. The cholera does not seem to be
readily conveyed byfomes; for it was observed that at the
hemp and flax wharfs of Petersburgh, where wares were
stored from many infected districts, the cholera did not appear any sooner than in other parts of the city.* Does it
dwell in the atmosphere? That, we should think, must
be frequently entirely renewed; for with a window, a door,
and a fire, there must be a rapid and total change of
air. We cannot say where this morbific force resides. We
might say it haunted a house, and there is no reason in the
nature of things why it might not continue to haunt it for
years as well as weeks. This is conceivable, and if it actually
were to occur, it might give a hint to the ingenious speculators about ghosts, who have recently sought to revive many
forgotten stories, and to advance into a place in history and
science what hitherto belonged to the region of fable alone.
Admitting as proved, which we are far from believing, that
in certain places certain individuals see apparitions, we might
imagine the phenomenon to be thus accounted for. That
the human body in certain conditions can emit an influence
capable of affecting others, and yet only to be detected by a
