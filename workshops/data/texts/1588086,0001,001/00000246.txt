ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


blue, the gall-bladder distended with bile, the kidneys also
indigo-blue, the stomach empty, and its villous coat brittle,
with here and there inflamed-like spots on it, the bladder
empty, the brain bloodless, the cellular tissue generally anasarcous. Arsenic was detected in the pleural serum. By
an approximate calculation it was supposed that the hydrogen this gentleman inhaled had contained the equivalent
arsenic of twelve grains of the oxide."*
We tried it only in one case, which, although a very bad
one, recovered. We should be inclined to use it frequently
in cases of great collapse, particularly when the vomiting
prevented any medicine remaining in the stomach.
The introduction of ether and chloroform opens an important consideration as to the propriety of giving medicines by
inhalation. Many and obvious advantages attend this mode
of administration. One of the most important is the vast surface upon which the remedy may act. In such a rapid and
powerful disease as the cholera, it is of the utmost consequence
to produce a prompt antagonistic effect. This may be done
by applying the specific in the form of vapour to the lining
membrane of the lungs, better than by any other means. There
are certain mechanical difficulties attending the process which
we doubt not might easily be overcome by a little ingenuity.
Perhaps the best way of giving it would be to diffuse it
through water; moisten a sponge with this arseniuretted
water, and hold it near the patient's mouth and nose, so that
he might inhale the disengaged gas, which would be considerably diluted. We must recollect, however, that this
substance is a most virulent poison, and the greatest caution
is necessary in using it.
