ITS TREATMENT-TOBACCO.


257


Tobacco we have little experience of in cholera; but we
should feel disposed to try it in certain cases, if we again had
the opportunity. The cases for which it would best answer
are those attended with much depression, vomiting, eructation, and obstinate dysuria, or suppression of urine, along
with pains in the bowels and cramps, and oppression of the
chest.
Grant* relates how a peasant washed himself and his wife
with an infusion of tobacco one evening at nine o'clock, and
that at ten o'clock they became giddy and as if drunken, that
afterwards the man was attacked with violent eructation
and vomiting, and his wife with diarrhcea and gripes. In
the morning the physician who saw them found them both
suffering from insatiable thirst, quick pulse, dry and hot skin,
and the man from violent tormina, inclination to vomit,
cramps in the hand and arms, and constriction of the chest;
the woman from anxiety, nausea, and oppressed, hurried
respiration.
General symptoms.-Great weariness; languor; and debility of the extremities and trembling of the hands and
feet; general debility and coldness; trembling of the hands,
after which he lies as if paralyzed, with stupor, headach;
