vital test, all must allow: and that this influence can dwell for
weeks in a place, is also undoubtedly true. Suppose that a
person is murdered, it is possible that in the terror and
agony of his hour of horror he may generate a peculiar
emanation from his person, which may linger in the place
where the deed of death took place; and it is equally possible that certain delicately organized individuals, alive to all
the finest influences which affect the nervous systems of persons so constituted, on entering the chamber where this emanation is, may become morbidly'affected, and the specific form
of morbid action may be a spectral illusion. If all this be
admitted, thenwe shall have a good clue to many ghost-stories;
and if it be not admitted, then we must be content to wait
till the sun rises upon " the night side of nature."  In the
meantime, we would advise any of our readers who are interested in idle speculations of this kind to read a very ingenious and able article upon ghosts and ghost-seers which
appeared in Number XVIII. of the North British Review.
