"A  Sepoy was bit by a long snake, supposed to be a
Cobra di capello. Iis jaws became locked in less than a
quarter of an hour, and very little sign of life remained.
Four large punctures were observed in the ancle, to which
eau de luce being applied, the man gave signs of sensibility
by drawing up his legs. Two bottles of Madeira were then
made warm, and the jaws being forced open so as to introduce a funnel, almost the whole of the wine in the course of
half an hour was then poured down. The application of the
eau de luce was continued for three hours, till the whole of
the bottle was expended.   The patient was now totally
without any sense of feeling whatever, and had it not been
for a gentle heave of his breast every two or three minutes,
I should have thought him dead.
"He remained in this torpid state for four hours, and
then began to show signs of returning life. It was twelve
hours more before he recovered his speech, and he continued
many days in a very languid state. He is now one of the
stoutest men in the first grenadier company."
Wibmer* gives the following summary of the effects of
snake poisons.  After describing the local effects of the bite,
lie says that they are attended with inclination to vomit;
fainting fits; small, irregular pulse; thirst; frequent cardialgia; vomiting of bilious fluid; anguish; oppression;
difficulty of breathing; dimness of sight; loss of consciousness; trembling of the limbs; universal loss of power; and
death from a few minutes to several days after the reception
of the poison.
