ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


tional cases in which the diarrhea was absent, presented an
abortive form of the complaint. To induce us to call it the
first stage, it must be very constant. If in a very considerable number of cases it is absent, then we are not entitled to
look upon it as essentially related to the cholera. If it
were a very unusual phenomenon, then indeed from its frequent attendance upon cholera, and cholera alone, we might
be inclined to consider them as very closely allied. If it
never preceded any other disease except cholera, the evidence in favour of the views just stated would rise in value.
Lastly, if there were no other plausible explanation of its
occurrence, except as a part of the clholera, we might throw
the blame of it upon this epidemic for want of something else.
Is diarrhoea a constant attendant or precursor of cholera?
and when absent, does cholera appear in a modified form?
These two questions we shall answer simultaneously by giving
a few individual cases when the absence of the diarrhoea was
certain; then some examples of large bodies of men who
seem to have had cholera without having previously had
diarrhoea; thirdly, the general testimony of practitioners in
India; and lastly, the statistical returns afforded by our own
observations.
Our first example shall be that of a physician who was familiar with all the symptoms of cholera. Dr. Quin* thus describes his own seizure,-" I was suddenly attacked by cholera
during dinner, without any premonitory symptoms. I fell
down senseless." After describing the effects of the remedy
he took, which mitigated the symptoms, hle says, " I had no
diarrhoea, although at every instant the violent cholicky
pain made me think it was going to come."
The two following cases occurred in our own practice, and
we made particular inquiries whether there had not been some
