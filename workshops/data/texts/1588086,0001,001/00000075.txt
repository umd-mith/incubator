CHAPTER 11.
IS IT CONTAGIOUS?
WE have done with the march of cholera from India to
Britain, and we now come to speak, hot of its progress, but
of its diffusion. This is not only a different question but
one which requires an opposite method of investigation.
As an illustration, let us suppose that we wished to explain
such a phenomenon as this. A wind is observed to blow always in a given direction from south-east to north-west, and
this wind is of a peculiar quality, and as it proceeds on its
course, it spreads to a certain extent through the surrounding atmosphere. In seeking to determine the force and
direction of this moving column of air, we must take the
measurement of the earth as the basis of our calculation, and
we may arrive at the conclusion that the phenomenon is
caused by the difference in the velocity of the atmosphere
at the poles and at the equator; but this does not bring
us a step nearer the explanation of its diffusion.  To ascertain this we must make a series of experiments, as well
as observations, and by doing so in the laboratory we
may arrive at the knowledge of the law that gases tend to
intermingle with one another in the inverse ratio of their
density. The knowledge of this latter law would not at all
assist us in explaining the trade-winds, any more than
would the trade-winds explain the diffusion of gases. So
