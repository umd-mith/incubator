mentioning the word in their hearing;-and it did not seem
altogether consistent to allow the Town Council to discuss and
make frequent mention of the ominous subject, and to permit

Although for a considerable time-some weeks-no efficient
steps were taken by the city authorities for giving medical
aid, yet fromn the first there was a sort of attempt made to
obtain a report of all the cholera cases, which were daily
published in the papers. This was first done by the police
and Town Council, who sent their emissaries wherever
a case of cholera was reported to be, to ascertain the fact,
and certify it, as it was called. Accordingly, we thought it
right to send a daily return of our cases to the Lord Provost,
as it seemed his wish to obtain all information, whether he
gave any to others or not. We did this for some time, until
we found that these police emissaries, or persons calling themselves so, were using their endeavours to deter our patients
from continuing under our charge, by speaking contemptuously of the medicines we gave them, and even by threatening them with the loss of certain benefits which the town
was to give to the poor people, unless they employed the
parish doctor. After this we resolved to make no more
returns, except to the Board of Health at London, to which
body we accordingly sent a full report of every case of cholera
which was treated by us, and we may give the following acknowledgment of their receipt, by the Secretary of the
Board:
