ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


ticular cases occasionally transmitted from the Local Boards
to the Central Board of Health, constant mention is made of
the presence of diarrhoea, often two or three days before the
violent attack came on.  But, perhaps, one of the most interesting and instructive illustrations of the extent to which
this premonitory system is present in a population in which
cholera is prevalent, is afforded by the remarkable history of
the progress and termination of this epidemic at Bilston and
the neighbouring district in 1832. This pestilence raged in
Bilston with greater violence than in any other part of the
United Kingdom. Out of 14,700 inhabitants, 3568 were
attacked with cholera, out of whom 792 died in less than
seven weeks; that is, one-fourth of the whole population were
subjects of the disease, and one-fifth part of those attacked
died.
"The Rev. William Leigh, the enlightened and benevolent clergyman of Bilston, whose exertions to mitigate the
sufferings of his parishioners during this melancholy visitation were most exemplary and indefatigable, gives the following description of their condition:" 'The pestilence,' he says, ' continues its ravages amongst
us in a frightful manner.  Our necessities are increasing
every hour, and our resources are fast failing us. Three
hundred pounds have been granted to the Board of Health
out of the poor-rates; but this sum will not pay for the
coffins of the dead. All kind of business is at a stand. Nothing reigns here but want and disease-death and desolation.  Two of our medical men have perished; two more
have left the place to recruit their exhausted strength; and
my respectable neighbours are nearly worn out by mental
anxiety and exertion. I have been confined to my house
since last Thursday, and nearly the whole of that time to
my bed.'
