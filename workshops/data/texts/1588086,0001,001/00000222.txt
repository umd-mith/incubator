ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


the following testimonial was given him by the Government
district-physician, Dr. von Merk:-" As regards the duration of the prevailing epidemic, this was in some districts
extremely short, and the course rapid and severe; the result,
owing to the judicious treatment, generally favourable; hence
the proportion of deaths compared to other places where the
epidemic raged was small. The Homoeopathic treatment,
which was carried out here to a great extent by Dr. Gerstel,
was the cause of the favourable result."*
Our countryman, Dr. Quin, being then on the Continent,
and acquainted with Homoeopathy, having heard of the severity of the disease in Moravia, and how Dr. Gerstel was
engaging it single-handed, with the gallantry of a crusader,
started to join him, and oppose the rapidly advancing foe.
His life had nearly paid the forfeit of his devotion. He was
seized with cholera, but rapidly restored, and was enabled to
be of great service to the sick. The chief magistrate of the
town, one Ernest Dieble-a sort of Lord Provost (very unlike ours, as will be seen by and bye)-by the desire of the
Council, sent him a letter of thanks, couched in very flattering terms, and what is of more consequence, a certified
list of the number of deaths under the various modes of
treatment.  From   this we learn that the number of inhabitants was 6671; that from the 7th November 1831, to
the 5th February 1832, 680 were attacked, and of these
540 recovered, and 140 died. The deaths and recoveries
being thus distributed:Affected.  Cured.  Died.
Treated Allopathically,..   331   229   102
Treated Homceopathically,..  278  251    27
Treated by camphor alone,..  71   60    11
This gives a mortality of about 33 per cent. to'the Allopathic physicians, 10 per cent. to the Homoeopathic physi* Dudgeon's Pamphlet on Cholera.
