countenance was calm, without any appearance of suffering,
the appetite tolerable, and the abdomen quite free of tenderness. The pulse, however, quickly sunk, the voice failed,
and death took place in eleven hours; and on dissection,
about twenty grains of arsenic were found in the stomach,
with strong signs of inflammation. â€”In a case communicated
to me by a former pupil, Mr. Adams of Glasgow-that of a
woman who died five hours after taking six drachms of
arsenic, there was some vomiting not long after she swallowed it; but subsequently she presented no prominent
symptoms except a ghastly expression, redness of the eyes,
a fluttering pulse, and extreme prostration, until within half
an hour before death, when the action of an emetic and the
stomach-pump was followed by severe burning pain."*
The last case is so like one of cholera, that we are sure if
the epidemic were prevailing it would have passed for a
severe seizure of the disease.
We look upon arsenic as a forlorn hope in those very bad
cases where there are hardly any symptoms present except
coldness, lividity, thirst, a fluttering pulse, or no pulse, and
great apprehension (alas! often too well foundedt) of immediate death.  In this class of cases, of which several will be
found among those we have published, we should be inclined,
had we to treat them over again, to give nothing but arsenic,
and that, too, in the largest dose we ever employ. We should
give a drop of the first centesimal dilution every half-hour,
and no other medicine.  The general experience of Homceopathic practitioners is in favour of the great value of arsenic
in the cholera.
The mode of administration must depend upon the nature
of the case. If there is not constant vomiting, we should
