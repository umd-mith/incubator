impression of many,-that arsenic, when it proves fatal,
always produces violent and well-marked symptoms. It
will of course be understood that cases of the present kind
pass by insensible shades into those of the first class,-the
following for example, being intermediate between the two:
A young man had frequent vomiting and diarrhcea, which
were supposed to depend on indigestion merely, as the
