ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


shall quote at some length the observations of Reichenbach
upon this subject:".59. Having detected in crystals a force, which, although
quite different from magnetism, yet exhibited a very marked
analogy with it; and considering, on the other hand, that
animal magnetism, although likewise different from ordinary magnetism, yet showed a similar analogy to it, he was
led to inquire, whether lie could discover any common properties in the phenomena of these two forces, and to what
extent? And also, whether animal magnetism, like the
crystalline force, might not be subject to physical laws? As
crystallization seems to mark the transition from organic to
inorganic nature, he ventured to hope, that by experiment
he might discover a point of connection between animal
magnetism and physics, or perhaps even obtain, for animal
magnetism, that firm foundation in physics which had so
long been sought for in vain.
" 60. But to prepare the way, it appeared, above all things,
necessary to ascertain the part whiclh in all these phenomena is played by terrestrial magnetism. If a magnet or a
crystal produces so decided an effect on sensitive persons, it
is certain that the magnetism of the earth, which gives the
needle its direction, cannot be without influence on the
animal nerve. And thus it was obvious, that it would be
impossible to obtain any pure result from any experiment as
long as this powerful agent, which must act in some way,
was not subject to measurement and calculation, with a view
to its elimination. With this idea, trials were made with
both healthy and diseased individuals, as M. Schuh, M.
Schmidt, surgeons; Mdlles. Nowotny, Sturmann, Maix,
Reichel, Atzmannsdorfer, and others, in different circumstances and at different times.
"61. M. Schuh had, in the house then inhabited by him,
