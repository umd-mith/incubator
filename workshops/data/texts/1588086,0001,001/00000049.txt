of the basin, and could not be traced over the mountains.
The Medical Board of Bengal, in a letter to that of Bombay, observes:-" The disease would sometimes take a complete circle round a village, and leaving it untouched, pass
on, as if it were about wholly to depart from the district.
Then after the lapse of some weeks or even months, it would

by 1820, it had added Siam and Malay to its dark do
