clear, or sometimes red-coloured serum, which also poured
from the spinal canal.
Brain.-Constant and unusually developed hyperaemia;
all the vessels are distended with the contained blood. The
injection appears to have supervened when a previously existing congestion was at its height, and was particularly
well seen on the under surface of the corpus callosum. Together with this, oedema of the brain, (Gehirn-cedem.) On
separating the membranes, which is always easily accomplished, a quantity of serum flows out; the ventricles of
the brain are more or less filled with serum, and even dilated
in cases of prolonged duration of the disease.  The substance of the brain is, in general, tenacious and firm, and of
a peculiar and remarkable white colour, (most excellent specimens for anatomical study.) This state existed equally in
all the cases examined, whether death had occurred after a
few hours or several days. In the commencement of the
epidemic, there occurred cases in which the brain was flabby
and soft, but only in such patients as sunk in a few hours, or,
for the most part, in a very short time. In a few instances,
and particularly towards the end of the epidemic, meningitis
made its appearance, with extensive purulent exudations.
Hlyperaemia of the spinal marrow, which was at the same
time firm and tenacious; a quantity of serum in the arachnoid sheath; in the spinal canal distention of the veins with
blood. There occur frequently in the araclinoid small par-.
ticles of cartilage of this form X; at Moscow, this appearance, which indeed may often be observed, was declared to
be characteristic of cholera.
Throat.-Swelling of the mucous glands at the base of the
tongue, (which are hard and bluish-red); mucous membrane of the cesophagus and larynx dark-red, from the inactivity of the venous system, nothing besides.
