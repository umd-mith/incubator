came affected with constricting pain and burning in the
stomach, feeble pulse, cold sweats, and cadaverous expression, under which symptoms he died four hours later. Orfila
justly designates this case as the most extraordinary instance
of poisoning with arsenic that has come under his notice.A seventh is related by Mr. Holland of Manchester, where
death took place in the course of eight or nine hours, and
the symptoms were at first some vomiting, afterwards little
else but faintness, sickness, a sullen expression, and a general appearance which led those around to suppose the individual intoxicated.-Professor Chaussier has described a
still more striking case than any yet mentioned. A stout
middle-aged man swallowed a large quantity of arsenic in
fragments, and died in a few hours. He experienced nothing
but great feebleness and frequent tendency to fainting. The
stomach and intestines were not in the slightest degree affected during life; and no morbid appearance could be discovered in them after death.-A similar instance, not less
remarkable, has been communicated to me by Mr. Macaulay
of Leicester, where the individual died with narcotic symptoms only within two hours after taking nearly a quarter of
a pound of arsenic.-Another, fatal in four hours, has been
described by Mr. Wright, where the symptoms were vomiting under the use of emetics, great exhaustion, feeble hurried pulse, cold sweating, drowsiness, and finally stupor. In
this case the quantity of arsenic taken was about an ounce.

old woman stole and ate a cake, which had been poisoned
with arsenic for rats. She died in twelve hours, suffering,
says Morgagni, rather from excessive prostration of strength
than from pain or convulsions.-The following case related
by M. Laborde is most remarkable in its circumstances. A
young woman was caught in the act of swallowing little
