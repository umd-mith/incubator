of the Russians from another quarter.
Instead of attempting to force the Caucasian passes, it
crept along the shores of the Caspian to Astrachan, at the
mouth of the Volga, where it arrived on the 1st of August,
and numbered nearly a hundred victims a-day. It also extended along the rivers Terek and Kuma into the province
of the Caucasians.*
By the 21st of the same month, it had got as far as Saratoff, still following the course of the river, and therefore
advancing for a considerable distance in a north-easterly
direction. Here it was very deadly, having within a month
destroyed 2367 individuals.
Matters now began to look serious in Russia. The enemy
had got into the country, and seemed disposed to march up
the valley of the Volga; and if it did so, would soon arrive
at the old capital of the Muscovite empire, Moscow, which

which are connected by a canal, so as to form a triangular
