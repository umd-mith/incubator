tioners to obtain these results. Before going into a minute
criticism of the individual remedies, we shall state the general
measures which we have found of service in treating patients
affected with cholera, and then describe the medicines proper
to be used in each of the stages of the disease.
Beyond the administration of the specific medicine, the first
stage requires no peculiar management, except that quiet and
abstinence be strictly enjoined. In the second stage, however,
it is advisable to adopt auxiliary measures to aid the struggle
of the restorative powers of the system. The object of treatment is to induce a slow, steady reaction. Let this be borne
in mind. Too rapid a reaction is dangerous, and frequently
terminates the patient's life suddenly, or induces the consecutive fever. From experience, we should recommend the
following steps: let there be a general warmth in the apartment, by means of a fire, if the weather be cold; let the patient
be covered with two or thre'e blankets, not more; let bottles
of hot water be put at his feet and sides, if the body is
cold; if there are cramps, gentle and continual stroking of
the affected parts gives relief; the intense thirst must be
allayed by frequent moderate draughts of cold water. In
some cases we tried large draughts of hot water, but we cannot report very favourably on the result. There is no objection to their trial, however. They were recommended as
conducing to supply the want of animal heat. Neither can
we recommend embrocations of any kind, whether camphor
or turpentine. It is very doubtful if they do any good, and
they probably interfere with the action of the medicines.
Another thing of great importance to attend to is, that the
patient abstain from all food. Not unfrequently, when the
reaction sets in, there is a craving appetite; and as everything seems going on favourably, the physician is apt to indulge the patient's desire for something to eat. In repeated
