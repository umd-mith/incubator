ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


during the last epidemic, out of 636 cases, there were 317
deaths.* Dr. Dudgeon, in his able and interesting pamphlet
on the subject, calculates the mortality at 57 per cent. in
the Allopathic hospitals. We are disposed to think that he
has rather under-estimated it. According to Mr. Wilde,
the present editor of the Dublin Medical Review, whose acquirements in all departments of knowledge bring back the
idea of a bygone time when the physician was a man of
universal accomplishment, states in his work on Austria,
that the mortality in the general hospitals in Vienna of the
cholera, during its prevalence in 1831-32, was two-thirds of
those attacked.t
Dr. Miiller,+ speaking of the present epidemic, estimates
the mortality at two-thirds of all the cases; so that in comparing the results of the treatment of cholera in Vienna
under the two systems, we need not hesitate to accept of
Mr. Wilde's statement as true in the main,-that is, out of
all the patients in the Allopathic hospitals treated for
cholera, two-thirds died, and only one-third recovered; or,
out of 1000 taken into the hospital, above 700 were carried
out dead, never again to see the face of their friends. The
number of families suddenly left destitute by this mortality
is worth considering; for when we see figures representing
the amount of deaths, we are apt to forget that almost each
unit stands for a little cluster of human beings who are more
or less affected by its extinction.
The Homceopathic Hospital was conducted by Dr. Fleischmann, of whom Dr. Forbes (who might be called the Peel of
Old Physic-for a more complete surrender of a party was
never effected than was done in his memorable article, in* Dudgeon's Treatise on Asiatic Cholera, p. 24.
