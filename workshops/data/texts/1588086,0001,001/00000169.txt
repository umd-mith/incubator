nerves, and more especially of the solar plexus. We cannot
establish this theory by direct proof; all we can do is to
show that some powerful morbid action taking place in this
system of nerves might account for all the symptoms of the
disease, and that, in the manner and rapidity of its effects
upon the frame, it bears an analogy to those agents which
seem to act also primarily upon the nervous system.
Without entering upon controversial topics, we may state
that the generally received opinion of the function of the
ganglionic or sympathetic system of nerves is to endow the
various organs over which they are diffused-and that is all
the organs of the body-with their peculiar vitality, and to
associate them together, so that an impression made on one
organ may be conveyed to another at a distance. It is no
matter for our present object whether this be done by the
ganglionic nerves "per se," or in virtue of their intimate
union with another set of nerves. In short, the ganglionic
system is the seat of life, and through this seat of life there
run all the chords of motion, sensation, and sympathy. An
influence operating upon it has a double action; it affects
vitality directly, and it acts upon all the functions of the
body, because all these functions are more or less controlled
by the nervous system.
Suppose a noxious power to act upon the ganglionic system, what should we expect to be the consequences? If
the action were intense, it might arrest all vitality, and life
might cease suddenly with a general convulsion of the frame.
It would be like the cold finger of death touching the
balance-wheel of the machine, and instantly arresting all
the wheels whose complicated movements constitute the life
of our wonderful organism; or if the action were not sufficient for this, it would sensibly depress the vitality of the
system as its primary consequence, and derange all its func
