proper nervous influence from the mucous membrane of the
bowels, and the state of the blood produce such a condition
of that substance, that the thinner part of that fluid escapes
in violent gushes both from the intestines and from the stomach. So much for the effects of this morbid influence upon
some of the organs supplied by the ganglionic and respiratory nerves. Not less striking are the results of its propagation along the motory nerves. Through them it produces
the most violent cramps in the various voluntary muscles, so
that an attack of cholera has been mistaken for tetanus,
and has been compared to hydrophobia and other convulsive
diseases. It has also a marked effect upon the organs of the
senses. The eyes are dull, there is singing in the ears, the
voice is strangely altered, becoming a hollow whisper. The
intellect alone is unaffected. It is obvious, that after such
a morbid impression has ceased to act, the system must take
a long time to recover from the disorganization of its elements. Instant cure may be possible at the very first before
the secondary effects of the morbid action in the ganglionic
system have commenced; after that it is impossible. The
poisonous blood cannot be removed, and pure blood put into
the veins; this must be a slow process, and so long as this
goes on, great danger must attend the case. Cholera, unless
instantly arrested, must therefore always be a most dangerous disease under any system of treatment.
We may now assume that the hypothesis of a primary
morbid action in the ganglionic system would satisfactorily
account for most of the symptoms of cholera, and we shall
next consider the evidence in favour of such a condition being actually present. Any direct evidence derived from the
morbid anatomy of the disease comes properly into the next
division of the subject, where it will find its place; and in
the meantime we shall direct our inquiries to ascertain
