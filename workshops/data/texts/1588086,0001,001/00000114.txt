certain phenomena, without any reference to their immediate
origin."*
The terms " predisposing," " exciting," and " proximate,"
although technical in their character, and generally confined
in their use to pathological language, express the conditions
under which all complicated phenomena take place. For
example, suppose a hay-stack burned down, and we were to
investigate the various steps of the operation; suppose we
ascertained that some miscreant had soaked one part with
turpentine, and thus had rendered it more liable to catch
fire-this would be the predisposing cause of its combustion. Tlhen suppose the fellow had lighted a large fire of
shavings to the windward of the stack, and that the wind,
laden with burning embers, had blown upon that part which
had been prepared by the turpentine to catch fire readily, we
should call that the exciting cause. Let us observe that we
have purposely chosen a mixed cause to illustrate the meaning of exciting cause. The wind without the embers might
have blown till it blew the haystack away altogether, but
would never have set it on fire; and the fire without the
wind would have been as innocent as if it were in the bosom
of Hecla. The wind and flame together combined to make
the exciting cause. The exciting causes of disease are almost
all of this character; and we often cannot analyze the component parts, which, by their mixture, make an exciting
cause. The meeting of the exciting cause, the fiery wind,
with the predisposing cause, the inflammable hay, give rise
to the combustion. But where is the place for the proximate cause? Flames and combustion are not the same.
The northern lights stream in flames along the sky where
there is nothing to burn, and the flames of the will-of-thewisp may be seen to play above the swamp, without at all
