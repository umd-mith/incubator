ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA


" As the only effectual means of giving notice to the class
of persons most liable to the disease, that medical aid was
to be obtained at the Dispensary at all hours, day and night,
bills announcing the fact and urging the importance of instant application, were ordered to be printed and posted at
all proper places; and generally, your medical officers were
empowered to take whatever steps, such as the employment
of nurses, &amp;c., they might think necessary to meet the crisis.
"Your Committee again met on the 14th, when it was
stated that there was reason to believe that the bills which
your Committee had published had been destroyed by the
police, and the person employed to put them up had been
apprehended for doing so; and your Secretary was requested
to inquire into the matter, and on inquiring, your Secretary
learned from the Superintendent of Police, that the bills
had been destroyed in terms of orders issued by the Lord
Provost. He then wrote the Lord Provost, (October 16th,)
to ask whether it was his intention to prevent the publication of such bills as those referred to, and if so, in what respect they were objectionable. His Lordship replied, 'It
was the opinion of the gentlemen who met with Dr. Sutherland from the Board of Health, that the placarding of bills
about cholera had a pernicious influence by creating alarm
in the public mind, and therefore ought to be prevented; in
consequence of which opinion,' he 'gave orders to the police
to prevent placarding of all such bills.'
" Your Secretary afterwards waited on the Lord Provost
on the subject, and finding him still resolved to prevent the
publication of these bills, gave orders to have others printed,
and put up especially in the Canongate, Cowgate, West
Port, and other places in which the cholera had already appeared, containing the same announcement, but not containing the word 'Cholera,' at that time prohibited.
