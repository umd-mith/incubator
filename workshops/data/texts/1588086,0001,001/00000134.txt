amount; but having shown what is meant by a sudden seizure,
we shall give some instances of the occurrence of such among
large bodies of men.
" The first was in a body of five thousand troops at Ganjam, 1781. 'It assailed them with almost inconceivable
fury at that place, on the 22d March. Men in perfect health

Besides those who died, above five hundred were admitted
into hospital that day. On the two following days the
disease continued unabated, and more than one-half of the
army was then ill.' "*

was at Surat when a native corps left that station, in November 1819. They were in high health, having had a few
slight cases of cholera in October, but before the march they
had all disappeared. He followed them a few days after on
the route to Baroda, a distance of eighty miles; and hearing
nothing of cholera on the way, he was astonished on arriving there to find the corps suffering from it in its worst form,
their casualties being from eight to fifteen daily. 'The
weather was cool and pleasant. There was really nothing
