ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


in Edinburgh, the following points were ascertained by a
judicial inquiry or precognition made, at the request of the
Board of Health, by the Sheriff of the county, who examined
different witnesses on each point till hlie was perfectly satisfied of its truth. 1st, That the woman herself had never

whether intercourse with the sick has the power of exciting
the disease or not. But if that intercourse has no such
power, it is plain that his mother, who never left her own
close, had no more business to take the disease than any
other of the inhabitants of Edinburgh or Leith, and her infection must have been a mere chance. The chances, there
