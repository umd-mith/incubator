ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


abdomen is only occasionally noticed. In advanced stages
of the disease purging generally ceases; but, in many cases,
a flow of watery fluid from the rectum takes place on any
change of position. The matters evacuated, after the first
emptying of the bowels, have been occasionally observed to
be greenish or yellowish, turbid, of a frothy appearance like
yeast, and sometimes bloody. In some cases they are inodorous, in others they have a rank fleshy smell. In one
fatal case, pure bile, it is said, was discharged. Perhaps
much of this variety may depend on the previous state of
the large intestine, especially in Europeans, who so generally
labour under a morbid condition of that organ; but by far
the most common appearance is that of pure serum, so thin
and colourless, as not to leave a stain on the patient's linen.
The next in order of frequency is the congee or rice-waterlike fluid; the mucus is at times so thoroughly mixed, however, with serum, as to give the whole the appearance of
milk or chyle. The evacuations have also been observed to
resemble soogee in colour and consistence; and these cases
were mild. Worms are very commonly discharged by stool.
The reappearance of fiecal matter, especially if tinged with
bile, seldom, perhaps never, takes place till the disease has
been subdued. The quantity of the clear watery fluid,
which is sometimes discharged, is exceedingly great; and,
were it uniform, it might afford us an easy solution of the debility, thirst, thickness of the blood, and other symptoms; but
it is unquestionable that the most fatal and rapid cases are
by no means those which are distinguished by excessive discharges. We have innumerable instances, on the contrary,
of death ensuing after one or two watery stools, without the
development of any other symptom affecting the natural
functions. Even collapse has come on before any evacuation by stool had taken place."
