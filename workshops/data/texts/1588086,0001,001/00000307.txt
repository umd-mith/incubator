" Thus the total number of cases, after deducting all doubtful ones, is 236; of these 179 recovered, and 57 died. This
gives a mortality of 24.15 per cent.,-a very serious mortality
certainly; and very lamentable it is that nearly one-fourth
of all who took cholera should have died; the virulence of
the disease appearing also in this, that the average duration
of the fatal cases was no more than fifty-eight hours. Still
there is much comfort in the thought, that under the treatment employed by the Medical Officers of the Dispensary,

which were reported from our Dispensary, with the corresponding results, there will remain 640; of which 435 died,
and 65 recovered: which gives a mortality of within a small
fraction of 68 per cent. of the cases treated otherwise than
Homceopathically; while as above stated, the mortality
among those treatedHomoeopathicallywas only 24.15 per cent.
"It was stated in the former report on this subject, that in
some instances the patients, when visited by the Physicians
of the Dispensary, were found in so great destitution, (being
without food, fuel, or clothing,) that it was necessary to send
