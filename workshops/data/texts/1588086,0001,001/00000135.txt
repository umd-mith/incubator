ITS PATHOLOGY-PREDISPOSING CAUSES.

fected; nor have I ever learned that the disease then existed
in the adjacent villages; and yet this solitary insulated body
of hardy soldiery, in the vigour of manhood and exciting
preparations for field-service, encamped upon a dry and open
spot of as healthy ground as any in the neighbourhood,
within the lines of a populous cantonment, and only a mile
distant from one of the largest cities in India, seemed devoted
alone to 'the pestilence that walked in darkness, and the
destruction that wasted at noonday,' without any assignable
cause, but that the seeds of the disease might have been
sown in their constitution during the month of October, at
Surat. Finally, the pestilence ceased as inexplicably as it
had commenced, after having in less than three weeks nearly
decimated the battalion."
Our next quotation shall be from the work of Mr. Scot,*
to which we have had occasion to refer frequently before.
His work is the summary of the Madras Report, which extends to 550 folio pages, besides his own opinion. It is the
work of a man of undoubted talent, and of great experience.
" This most formidable disease does not appear to be attended by any premonitory symptoms which can be regarded
as being at all peculiar to it; on the contrary, we may safely
assert, that it is of sudden invasion; for, though a slight
nausea, a laxity of the bowels, and a general feeling of indisposition are often found to precede cholera, yet these
symptoms are evidently common to many other diseases;
and they are especially frequent in this climate, without
being followed by any graver ailment. When such symptoms
are found to precede cholera, they might with more truth
be regarded as indicating merely a certain deranged state of
the alimentary organs-a condition of the body which certainly predisposes a person to an attack of cholera"
