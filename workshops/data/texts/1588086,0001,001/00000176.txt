ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


hollow on each side of the spine, leaving the cavity of the
thorax nearly empty. This appearance has been so remarkable as to induce Dr. Pollock, of H. M. 53d regiment, to conceive, that it could only be produced by the extrication of a
gas within the cavity of the pleura, capable of overcoming the
atmospheric pressure. It is understood, however, that opportunities were had of piercing the thorax of the dead body
under water, and that no gas was extricated. As there
appears to have been an absolute vacancy in the cavity of
the pleura, (that is to say, the lungs did not by any means
fill it,) it would seem that that viscus had exerted a contractile power, adequate to overcome the pressure of the
atmosphere. The blood found in the lungs has been always
very black. The heart and its larger vessels have been found
to be distended with blood, but not so generally as the apparent feebleness of their propelling power, and the evident
retreat of the blood to the centre, would have led us to expect. The right auricle and ventricle being gorged with
blood, is nothing peculiar to cholera; but some dissections
have shown the left cavities to be even filled with dark or
black blood, which we may reckon as a morbid appearance more peculiar to it. In the abdominal cavity, the peritonial coverings of the viscera, being serous membranes, present in general but little deviation from the healthy state;
occasionally, indeed, the morbid accumulation of blood in
the vessels of the viscera, imparting an appearance of turgidity and blueness, is evident on their exterior surfaces.
We also find them bearing marks of inflammation, especially
where the patient may have lingered long before death. In
other cases, the whole tube has had a blanched appearance, both externally and internally. The stomach and intestines generally preserve their ordinary volume. The appearance of the omentum is not sensibly affected in cholera.
