ITS SYMPTOMS.

pression of the countenance, a rapid intermittent pulse,
especially if the patient has been particularly exposed to the
choleraic influence, and if there is no other explanation of
the symptoms. For we may here observe, that during the
prevalence of cholera, hysterical females often are affected
by a train of symptoms very like the disease, but in reality
only an imitation of it, and not attended with danger. It
requires great tact to distinguish this unconscious feigning
from an attack of real cholera.
The first stage is probably never fatal in this country, but
in India we are disposed to believe that it may be so. Instances are on record of the natives being suddenly attacked
with giddiness when walking in the open air, and after having retched a little, they expirbd in a few minutes. A native
tailor at Bellary is said to have expired instantly with his
work in his hand, and in the very attitude in which he sat
when attacked by what was believed to be cholera. At Punderpoor three hundred and fifty people are described to
have died in one day, tumbling over each other lifeless on
the public streets. In a few days, says another writer, the
deaths were estimated at three thousand, and the patients
are described as having been knocked down dead as if by
lightning.
The first stage, when not fatal and not checked by its appropriate specific-and we cannot too soon or too often state
our firm conviction, that this stage is in the vast majority of
cases curable by a specific medicine, and that upon the timely
administration of this medicine hangs the fate of thousands
during the prevalence of the epidemic-if neither fatal nor
unchecked, it soon passes into the second stage, or stage of
collapse. The symptoms of this stage are numerous and well
marked, although it presents a great variety of forms, so
that we scarcely remember two cases precisely alike. We
shall employ the same classification as before.
