ITS PATHOLOGY-MORBID ANATOMY.

The stomach is found to be so variously affected as to destroy all grounds for pathological reasoning. It is. very
rarely found empty or much contracted after death, nor has
any appearance of spastic stricture of the pylorus been often
detected. It has, however, sometimes occurred. Its contents
appear to be chiefly the ingesta in an unaltered state: in
some cases, greenish, or yellow, or turbid matters are found.
The stomach has been said to have been found 'lined with
calomel.' Various appearances, either of active inflammation
or a congested state of the vessels, have been noticed, sometimes in one part, sometimes in another. The parts seem as
if they were sphacelated, thickened, softened, and friable;
and, in short, exhibit so great a variety of appearances, from
a perfectly natural state to the most morbid, that no particular light is thrown by them on the disease.
" The intestinal tube is sometimes collapsed, but oftener
found to be more or less filled with air, distended in some
parts into bags or pouches, containing whitish, turbid, dark,
or green-coloured fluid, and in others presenting the appearance of spastic constriction.  The latter, however, is not
common. No foecal or other solid matters are found in the
intestines, but very commonly large quantities of the congeelooking fluid, or of turbid, serous matter. The duodenum,
and occasionally the jejunum, have been found loaded with
an adherent, whitish or greenish mucus; at other times
they have been found seemingly denuded of their natural
mucus, and often perfectly healthy. Traces of bile in the
intestines, or of any substance apparently descended from the
stomach, are exceedingly rare. Sanguineous congestion, and
even active inflammation, are stated to be more common in
the bowels than in the stomach; but, on the other hand, instances are very numerous where no such indications have
been detected. The thoracic duct is stated to have been
