ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.

no sudden variations of temperature. The appearance of the
sky was peculiar: it was cloudy, but only partially so. The
clouds were not dense, or heavy, or fleeting; but thin and
fixed, with frequent breaks, through which the blue sky
appeared. They were generally of a dark grey colour; flat,

very fatal in Kallinga and other native departments of the
town; but no sooner had the season become regular, than
the epidemic ceased to be heard of." *
