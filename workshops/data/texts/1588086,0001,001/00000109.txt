IS IT CONTAGIOUS?

where the cholera prevailed, and died. A few days after,
the woman who arranged the body was seized, and then her
two children; and so the disorder spread in Schitomir.
" In Luga, an employe, who came from Petersburgh, was
the first person attacked.
" In St. Petersburgh, the first patient was a dean (on 4th
June) who came from Novoi Ladoga, an infected place. The
other early cases occurred on the great Neva; they were
boatmen in a wood boat from the infected district of Novgorod; they were followed by two labourers belonging to
another boat, next the ferrymen of the neighbourhood, and
the labourers at the exchange. On the 7th June, occurred
the first case among the inhabitants, in close proximity to
the boats on the left bank of the Neva.
" At Jamburg, the first patients were eight labourers who
had come from St. Petersburgh.
" At Rewal, also the first were two passengers who came
from St. Petersburglh by the steamer of 24th June. Both of
them died in the hospital, and thence the epidemic spread.
"At Riga, the widow P. was attacked on the 19th June,
having conime from St. Petersburgh by the steamer, and also
a cook of Count Siewcr's from the same place. Not till three
days after did there occur other cases there, two of persons
from the same neighbourhood."
We had intended giving some such examples from our own
experience as we have just quoted, but we believe it is quite
unnecessary, until at least the evidence afforded by these be
got rid of in some way or other; but we may state it as the
opinion of almost all with whom we have conversed on the
subject, and who have had opportunities of forming a correct
judgment, that intercourse with those ill of cholera increases
the liability to the disease; and therefore that in Scotland
the cholera is certainly contagious.
