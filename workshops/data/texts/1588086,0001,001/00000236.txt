or three fits of vomiting, with slight pain and heat in the
stomach.-A similar case has been related by Metzger. A
young woman died in a few hours, after suffering from
trivial diarrhoea, pain in the stomach, and strangury; her
death was immediately preceded by slight convulsions and
fits of suffocation; and on dissection the stomach and intestines were found quite healthy. Half an ounce of arsenic
was found in the stomach.-A third case, similar in its particulars to the two preceding, was submitted to me for investigation by the Sheriff of this county in 1825. The subject,

person expired in five hours, and vomiting never occurred,
even though emetics were given.-A fifth has been related
by M. Gerard of Beauvais. The subject was a man so addicted to drinking, that his daily allowance was a pint of
brandy. When first seen, there was so much tranquillity,
that doubts were entertained whether arsenic had really
been swallowed; but at length he was discovered actually

when some vomiting ensued; coldness of the extremities
and spasmodic flexion of the legs soon followed; and in a

case of the same kind has been described by Orfila. The
individual having swallowed three drachms at eight in the
morning, went about for two hours bidding adieu to his

easy vomiting. He suffered very little till one, when he be
