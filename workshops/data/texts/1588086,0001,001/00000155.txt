cases, it shows that out of every hundred cases of cholera
occurring, 12 will happen in properties using the town's
water, 6 of whom will die, and 6 recover; and 88 will happen in properties not using that water, 44 of whom will die,
and 44 recover."*
We may mention an incident that came under our notice
in Edinburgh in connexion with the want of water. A considerable time after the cholera had been in the city, the
authorities began to take measures for cleansing the worst
part of it. To do this they drew water from the city wells,
which supply the poor with water. To prevent the supply
to the engines used to wash the houses from running short,
they locked up the wells at night. The consequence was,
that many families who had not time, or had neglected to
get water in the day-time, had none all night. The cholera
generally occurs at night. A poor man was ill of it, and
during the night his daughter, who had been attending him,
was seized with the disease; all the water was done, and in a
state of intense agony from thirst, she rushed out to get some
from a neighbour, and struck herself on the door. She fell
to the ground, from which she could not rise, but was lifted
to her bed, where she soon died. This is a digression; but
it is to show the horrible inhumanity of depriving the poor
of water at a time when they are exposed to cholera.
We may conclude, then, that while we cannot avert the
plague from such towns as Edinburgh and Glasgow-the
former exposed to a damp atmosphere, the latter situated
on a river-we may prevent it altogether, or at least greatly
mitigate its severity, by judicious sanitary measures in such
towns as Paisley.
The impression upon the mind of almost all observers of
cholera seems to be, that at the time of its prevalence, there
