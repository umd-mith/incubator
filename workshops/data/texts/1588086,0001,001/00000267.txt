blood to convey its action to the heart. Whence it follows,
that its effects may be very different in these two circumstances.

frogs I could meet with. I preferred these animals because
they are livelier than others; because they die with greater
difficulty; because they are more irritable; and, lastly, because their muscles contract even several days after they are
