ON EPIDEMICS IN GENERAL.


demics, their essential characteristic is not the number of
their victims, which depends upon accidental circumstances.
And it is of great importance that we should remember this;
for in turning from such descriptions of death to the recent
or present epidemic of Cholera, in some parts of this country, if the only interest were derived from the bills of
mortality, it would immediately subside, when we found
but a very trifling increase in the numbers on these tables,
or perhaps no increase at all. Although in a life-insurance
point of view, the cholera may be quite insignificant, yet
as a member of the class of fatal epidemics, it is most
interesting and important; and who knows that it may
not become invested with the more terrible interest of being
a great mortality by becoming a general, instead of a partial
disease? The mortality of cholera is very great; if it were
as wide-spread as it is malignant, the result would be frightful. And we should bear in mind that we can do but little to
prevent its diffusion, and indeed not much more to lessen its
fatality. Thus we find this epidemic to be generically bound
up with former ones; and we believe it is only by investigating what facts are common to all, that we shall arrive
at a knowledge of the laws that regulate the occurrence and
the course of each, and shall learn why they have so baffled
all attempts to arrest their progress, and neutralize their
destructive power.
One of the most striking features of many former plagues
is that they have not occurred without previous warning.
They appear to have had their origin in the planet we dwell
oni; and before their coming, the earth gave signs of some
great internal disturbance. The pestilence which swept its
surface, seemed the relief to those convulsions which shook
its frame. Or taking a higher point of view, we may regard
the wonderful succession of strange phenomena which pre
