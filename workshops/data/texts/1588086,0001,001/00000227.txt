efforts paralyzed by some unforeseen and untoward occurrence.
The remedy for the first stage of cholera is Camphor.
This was discovered by Hahnemann; and in the future
annals of science it will be mentioned as one of its brightest
achievements. It is a triumph over the subtlest force of
matter by the still subtler power of mind; and it seems
to have required that clear insight into the essential relation of things, by the possession of which the man of
genius is distinguished from the man of industry and talent
alone.*
As soon as the cholera invaded Europe, the Homoeopathic practitioners began to prepare their weapons for the
dread encounter; and the medicines they recommended and
used have all proved useful in the disease. But they groped
about in vain for the remedy for the first stage. In the
volume of the "Archiv. fiir die Homceopathie," for 1831,
there is a very able paper by Dr. Preu of Nuremberg, proving how closely the symptoms of arsenic and veratrum resemble those of cholera, and recommending their administration in the disease.  Dr. Schubert of Leipzig in addition
recommended ipecacuanha and chamomilla. All of these are
good in certain stages, but as yet no one had hit upon the
true specific. At this time, as we have seen, the cholera
was sweeping over Germany, and the believers in Homoeopathy all looked to Hahnemann, like the inhabitants of
Syracuse to Archimedes, for some definite instructions. Nor
* In Mr. Carlyle's fascinating work, "' Hero Worship," no mention is made
of the hero as a man of science. Should the author ever supply that deficiency, we take the liberty of recommending to his attention the character of
Hahnemann. We venture to do so, although we are quite aware that this
proposal, should it ever reach him, would suggest nothing but the ridiculous
to his mind, to be expressed by a thousand ludicrous similitudes and illustrations.
