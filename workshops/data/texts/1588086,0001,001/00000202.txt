ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


struck down by the poison, and dying without an effort, as
an ox dies from a blow upon the head:" CASE X.-Mrs. F., aged 46, went to bed in her usual
health between nine and ten, P. M., on the 29th of October; felt
pain in the head and chilly during the night, and especially
between three and four o'clock the following morning, when
the bowels. were copiously moved, and she began to vomit
with each evacuation of the bowels, which occurred every
eight or ten minutes; had also cramps in the legs and pain
at epigastrium. When seen first, a little after six o'clock of
the same morning, her face was cold and ghastly, and had
a peculiarly melancholy expression; she frequently repeated
the words, ' What is with me? I cannot live, I cannot live.'
She was very restless; the pulse languid and intermittent,
and the skin ice cold; she complained of pain in the loins.
" Secale, 1st diL, every five minutes.
"After a little time, she was violently cramped in the
fingers and toes. She then got camphor, repeated at short
intervals. There was no vomiting for quarter of an hour;
pulse became more languid, 76 in a minute, scarcely perceptible-; vomited and purged twice during the next quarter of an
hour; very restless; sighing and panting for want of breath.
" She then got arsen. 3d dil.
"Quarter past 7, A.M.-Pulse gone; cold clammy perspiration; vomiting of a pale-white, watery liquid, with gurgling in the throat.
" Carbo. veg. 3d trit., alternately with Ipecac. 3d dil.
" 9, A.M.-Collapse continues. Vomited once, and bowels
not open; fits of excessive restlessness, and cramps occasionally in the fingers and toes. Continue medicine.
"12 noon.-Much the same; no vomiting or purging;
great thirst; flying pains through the body.
