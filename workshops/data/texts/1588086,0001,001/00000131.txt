of making the earliest application for medical aid, and the
great danger the patient incurs in neglecting such a necessary precaution.'
"Mr. Hodgson, one of the two medical officers appointed

degree. I remember hearing of some ladies being attacked
who were out at a party one evening, one of whom was dead
the next day: but even in those instances, if you could learn
the particulars, you would find, I believe, that there has

In order to establish the proposition that diarrhea is the
first stage of cholera, it must be shown either that it is
always observed to be present, or that its absence can, in
some way or other, be satisfactorily accounted for.  If a previous diarrhoea be an essential part of cholera, and it must
be granted that a disease is not perfect. If it have not its
first stage, then we should expect to find that those excep
