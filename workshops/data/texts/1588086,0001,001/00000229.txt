and, according to the same principles, small doses of other
medicines in this and other diseases. We cannot help thinking, that if those who are in the habit of systematically
reviling the name of Hahnemann really knew how much
good sense, independently of all their other qualities, there
is in his writings, they might be led to pause before committing themselves against him any further; and we are
glad there is a prospect of obtaining access to his lesser
writings through a translation which we can venture to
guarantee as accurate and able, although we have not seen
it.*  Not only would the avowed foes of Homceopathy learn
much by studying his writings, but we are of opinion that
many of his followers, who are now seeking to enlarge Hahnemann, have no just idea of his real limits, and if instead of
making against him, to whom we owe everything, the accusation of bigotry, they were with the meekness of true wisdom
to study and ponder his works, they would delay their censure, and admit that when their experience amounted to a
hundredth part of his, it would be time enough to dogmatize.
The dogmatism of genius, by which the lives of thousands are
saved, is a very different thing from the dogmatism of the
neophyte, who must understand the process by which the
preserver of life attains his conclusions, before he will admit
them to be true.
Admitting the great law of healing to be, that " like cures
like," now that we know camphor to be the remedy for
cholera, we are only surprised that it should have required
Hahnemann to discover the fact. For nothing can be more
similar than the effects of camphor and the premonitory
