ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


Thoracic cavity.-In the majority of cases always at the
commencement of the epidemic, and in all patients who
sank rapidly, a peculiar unctuous feeling (like white of egg
or isinglass) in the pleural sack, and in a less degree in the
pericardium.
Heart.-Full of fluid blood, or else black unctuous clots
(generally);' also in many cases tough fibrinous coagula;
very often larger or smaller spots of ecchymosis on the pericardium; besides which there was nothing remarkable, except a great flabbiness of the muscular substance.
Lungs.-Remarkable anaemia of the capillary system in
the substance of the lungs, while black thick blood poured
in greater or less quantity out of the larger vessels. The
lungs are pale and whitish, and very dry to the touch. When
patients die after reaction has set in, those dark spots may
be already observed, scattered through the anoemic lung,
though in a very slight degree, which are observed in the
beginning of hypostatic pneumonia or acute oedema. When
death occurs later there is very often more extensively diffused oedema of the lungs, or completely developed hypostatic, and for the most part lobular pneumonia, with soft
red hepatization.
A bdominal cavity.-Capillary system of the liver aneemic;
in the larger vessels at times a quantity of blood, at others
very little. The liver presents but little to be remarked..The gall-bladder in general filled to distention with blackish,
tough, and unctuous bile.   In cases that had advanced
slowly, and in which the contents of the intestine showed the
admixture of bile, the gall-bladder was flaccid, or even entirely empty.
The Spleen small, and its capsule wrinkled; besides which,
it presented nothing abnormal, excepting where it had become degenerated from previous attacks of intermittent
