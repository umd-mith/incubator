ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.

they no longer leaped, but dragged their legs and bodies
along with great difficulty, and could scarcely withdraw their
thighs, when they were pricked with a needle, of the pain
of which they seemed almost insensible: by degrees they
became motionless and paralytic in every part of the body,
and after continuing a very short time in this state, died.
"I now opened the abdomen, and stimulated the nerves
that pass through it in their way from the vertebrae to the
thighs. I employed the strongest corrosives, but could excite no motion nor tremulus in the lower extremities. I
pricked the muscles with as little effect, and thrust a long
pin into the spinal marrow, without producing any motion

heart alone in some few of them continued to move languidly,
and its auricles were swelled and blackened by the blood
with which they were surcharged. This organ did not, however, seem to have suffered much from the activity of the
venom. It continued its motion, notwithstanding the entire
death of the other parts, and renewed its vibrations on being
strongly stimulated with needles. This motion and these
oscillations were, however, but of short duration after the
death of the animal.
"Persons have been sometimes met with, who, having
been bi( by a viper, have remained paralytic in some particular part of the body during life. A short time ago a

a viper, became, after various other complaints, paralytic
throughout the whole right side of her body, and could never
