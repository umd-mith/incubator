ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


according to a table given by Markus,* the number of men
treated in the extraordinary hospitals and houses for the
reception of patients generally, was 1724, and the number
of women 909. This was exclusive of the military force, who
had hospitals of their own.
The reason of the greater proportion of women to men
who have.taken cholera here, we naturally find in their having much more to do both with the dying and the dead.
With a devotion characteristic of their sex, they are always
found hanging over their sick friends, relatives, or neighbours, and it is women who arrange the bodies for interment.
The difference in the number of the sexes attacked by the
disease here thus becomes an argument in favour of its
contagiousness.
In regard to age as a predisposing cause, it has been observed, that infants at the breast db not seem liable to the
disease, which coincides with our own observations.  In the
following table will be found the results afforded by the cases
treated at the Homceopathic Dispensary:TABLE SHOWING THE RELATION OF AGE AND SEX TO THE NUMBEIRS
