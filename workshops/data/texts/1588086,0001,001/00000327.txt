18th.-Died this morning at six o'clock.
The following four cases died after partially recovering from the
second and third stages of the disease:CASE XVI.
R. A., aged 24.-This young woman had been previously in perfect health, and had attended her brother (Case VI.) during his last
illness in his own house. She returned home the evening of his
death, and was taken ill at ten, P.M., the same night. We saw her
first at five, A.M., the following morning of the 25th of October.
She was standing on the floor, supported by her mother, almost
naked. The room was quite dark, and the only light we could
procure was from the policeman's lantern who accompanied us up
to the room. She was purging and vomiting violently, and throwing her arms wildly about. It was with difficulty we got her into
bed. The surface of the body was cold; the pulse was gone; violent cramps in limbs.
Arsenic, 3d dil., a dose every quarter of an hour.
Eleven, A.M.-She had been sleeping a little, and had vomited and
purged only once since seven, A.M. The pulse was imperceptible;
the cramps less severe; skin cold; voice quite audible.
Continue Arsen.
Two, P.M.-No change. Continue medicine.
Seven, P.M.-She is still much cramped, but her appearance is improved. The coldness of the surface is not so intense; the breath
is warm.
Nux v., 3d dil., and Arsen., alternately every half-hour.
Half-past eleven, P.M.-No pulse is perceptible; the cramps still
continue, though not quite so severe or frequent. She passed her
faces unconsciously; she has been raving much, but when roused
speaks sensibly. The tongue is covered with a white fur; she is
very thirsty; her eyes are half-open and deeply sunk. Continue
medicine.
Oct. 26th, nine, A.M.-A little better, more sensible and more
