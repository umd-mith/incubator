ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


ramollissement did exist. The abnormal development of the
capillary vessels filled with blackened blood, has given rise
to the erroneous belief of the existence of gangrene. Gastritis, too, except to a very limited extent in exceptional
cases, is not found during the cyanic period. Three groups
of lesions, independently of altered colour, were observed:
1. Granules with no contents. 2. Pyriform granulations,
containing a white, albuminous, purulent-looking substance,
this being sometimes fluid, and oftener so thick as not to
pass out even after the incision of the granule. 3. The
mucous membrane was penetrated, and especially at the
great cul de sac of the stomach, by numbers of minute holes
or depressions visible to the naked eye. When death took
place in the algide period, the external appearance of the
intestinal canal was most remarkable, so deeply coloured was
it by the network of vessels-ecchymosis sometimes resulting from the great afflux of blood.
"' Not that the capillaries remained filled. They were so
when an unusual, extraordinary, and prodigious afflux converged towards this point; and they remained coloured and
varnished, by the red portion of the blood separated from
the colourless portion. They constituted a new order of
organs, usurping functions which were not their own, and
invading, in the full force of the expression, those of other
organs. The intestine thus became transformed into a reparatory and secreting agent, which exhaled and allowed the
transudation of white blood; and if globules became mixed
with this intestinal sweat, then the albuminous lymph.was
rose-coloured, the villi ceased to absorb, and the functions of
the other secreting organs of the body were no longer performed.' (Tom. xii. p. 199.)
