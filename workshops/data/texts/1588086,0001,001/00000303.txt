ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN EDINBURGH.


281


We believe the best way of giving an accurate idea of our
proceedings will be by the following extracts from the
Report of the Acting Committee of the Homceopathic Dispensary, and we consider it but justice to those Homoeopathic
practitioners who devoted themselves to the toilsome, often
thankless and perilous duty, that their names should be
thus recorded:" Whenever the existence of Asiatic cholera in Edinburgh
-an event, as appears from your minutes anticipated by
you since the 8th November last-had been officially announced, it seemed to your Committee that the time was
come for them to use the most prompt and efficient means
in their power, at least to alleviate if they might not stay
that terrible disease.
" With this view a meeting of your Committee was held
on the 7th October current, when it was resolved, after conference with your medical officers, the ordinary physicians
of the Dispensary, who generously undertook the very severe
duties which the arrangement imposed on them, that the
Dispensary should be kept open, and one of the medical
officers should be in attendance, at all hours, day and night,
during the prevalence of cholera in Edinburgh. It is here
to be mentioned that the ordinary physicians, viz.-Dr.
Russell, Dr. Wielobycki, Dr. Lyschinski, and Dr. Sutherland,
all graduates of our University, have been kindly assisted
in these duties by Dr. Atkin of Portobello, who has a similar
degree, and Dr. Cockburn, a licentiate of the College of
Surgeons of Edinburgh; and when it is considered that the
services of these gentlemen are perfectly gratuitous, your
Committee feel sure you will accord them your warmest
thanks. Arrangements have also recently been made to
enable Dr. Cockburn, in the meantime, to be resident in the
Dispensary.
