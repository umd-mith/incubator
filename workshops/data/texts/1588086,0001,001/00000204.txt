ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


" Camphor to smell, and afterwards arsenicum, 3d dil.,
frequently repeated.
"Half-past 8, A.M.-Profuse warm perspiration over the
whole body; no vomiting or purging; slight cramps; urine
suppressed; great thirst; pulse barely perceptible.
" 11, A.M.-Countenance cadaverous; very breathless;
moaning from pain. Sunk and died at half-past 1, P.M.,
twenty-five hours ill, and twenty hours under treatment."
It only remains for us now to describe the symptoms of the
consecutive fever into which patients sometimes fall after
coming out of the other stages of the disease.  We have
had but little experience in this form of the disease, as there
were only four cases of consecutive fever, out of 236 cases of
cholera, treated homceopathically; whereas, out of 230 cases
treated at the Cholera Hospital, there were 39 fatal ones
from this cause. Two out of our four cases recovered. So
that out of 236 cases we had two deaths from the consecutive
fever; and in the hospital there were, out of nearly the same
number of patients, 39 deaths.  We advert to this here in
passing, and shall reserve a fuller comparison of the results
of treatment for the next Chapter.
