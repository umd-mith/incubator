ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


ripening. To the miasmata thus produced I have always
attributed the fevers which prevail there; for there is neither
swamp of any other description nor wood for a great distance, and the natural soil is a dry, reddish, sandy substance,
consisting almost entirely of decomposed granite. Here, as in
all other similarly unhealthy places, the epidemic (cholera)
prevailed to an extraordinary degree. Mr. Scott states, that
it appeared, from the best information he possessed on the subject, that the mortality was greater there than at any other
place in the Peninsula. Very different was the case at Bangalore, lying on an eminence seventy-five miles to the westward, 700 feet higher than Seringapatam, and 3000 above
the sea: it is the highest ground of the Mysore, and the
coolest and healthiest station on the establishment. It was
never visited by the epidemic but in a very trifling manner.
" After adverting to the attraction of the choleraic poison
for moisture, and the remarkable predilection of cholera for
all places where human beings are thickly crowded together,
and where the effluvia from the excretions are consequently
abundant, Dr. Parkes, late an army surgeon in India, describes the rise and progress of two epidemics which he witnessed; one in 1842, at Moulmein, in the Tenasserim provinces, and the other at Madras, in 1845, both being, he
says, fair types of the general manner in which cholera
spreads in India.
" ' Some time in the early part of 1842,' he says, ' cholera
appeared in the northern parts of Burmah, and, passing in a

consternation at Ava and Ameerapoora. After traversing
these cities, it passed down to Rangoon, pursuing the course
of the Irrawaddy and its tributaries, and attacking chiefly
the towns and villages situated on the banks of these rivers.
Still pursuing a southerly course, in August it appeared in
