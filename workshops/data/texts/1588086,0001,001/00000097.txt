dread of the disease, avoided as carefully as possible all
intercourse whatever with the infected persons and houses.
" All the district and villages more immediately around
Bathgate totally escaped any attack of cholera. The nearest point at which the disease is known to have occurred
was at Linlithgow, which lies about seven miles to the north,
where one or two suspicious but not decided cases were observed. Towards the east, Mr. Millar's of Niddry Mains,
about eight miles distant; and to the south, some cases
to be afterwards mentioned, which occurred at Carnwath,
ten or eleven miles distant, were, I believe, the nearest seen
in these directions; and on the west side the disease does
not seem to have shown itself nearer than Clarklstone, a village thirteen miles distant, and in which it prevailed to a
considerable extent. In this calculation, I do not of course
include some instances in which the affection was observed
in the passengers in the canal boats, and others who were
passing through the district, or who came to it, after being
already exposed in infected localities, and died without propagating the disease. One or two such cases were seen by
the medical men both of Linlithgow and Broxburn."
Here, as in the case of the plague at Larnaka in Cyprus,
the fuel was not then ready, and the disease appeared like
a spark from a flint without tinder for it to fall on, a moment incandescent, and straightway cold again. It may
burn the hand of an individual, but cannot fire a village.,
We shall conclude our extracts by the following, which
enables us to bring forward the valuable authority of Professor Alison, who is celebrated alike for his wisdom and his
goodness:" Before cholera reached Edinburgh, it raged for some
time previously in a severe degree in the district of country
lying to the east of the city, as in Haddington, Tranent,
