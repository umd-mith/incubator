ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


had they long to wait. On the 10th of September 1831, he
wrote a letter which was published by the editors of the
Archiv., not suggesting a variety of medicines, which would
most likely prove suitable, but stating in the simplest and
most emphatic way what was the sole remedy at the beginning of the disease. "Every one," he says, " the instant any
of his friends take ill of the cholera, must immediately treat
them himself with camphor, and not wait for medical aid,
which even if it were good would generally come too late. * * *
In the first stage camphor gives rapid relief, but the patient's
friends must themselves employ it, as the stage soon ends
either in death or in the second stage, which is more difficult
to be cured, and not with camphor. In the first stage, accordingly, the patient must get as often as possible, at least
every five minutes, a drop of spirit of camphor, (from one
ounce of camphor to twelve of spirit of wine,) on a lump of
sugar, or in a spoonful of water." These orders were given
by Hahnemann before he had ever seen a case of cholera,
and now when the epidemic has been treated by hundreds of
Homoeopathic practitioners, there is nothing in them to change
and nothing to them to add; they exhausted the subject.
Hahnemann not only instantly saw the right remedy, but the
right dose. This was from no modification of his principles
to meet the cholera. In the preface to camphor in the
Reine Arzneimittellehre, published in 1820, (if we mistake
not, the second edition is 1825,) Hahnemann recommends a
grain of camphor, dissolved in eight grains of alcohol, to be
diffused through 400 grains of luke-warm water, and does
not speak of any further dilution, but says that it should be
administered in very frequently repeated doses. He says it
is useful as a palliative in a form of influenza, which is endemic in Siberia, and spread over Europe at one time.
It is important to bring into view that Hahnemann before
