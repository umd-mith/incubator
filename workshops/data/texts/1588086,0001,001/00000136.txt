114             ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.
Dispensary, in 125 there had been gastro-intestinal derangement, and in 99 there had certainly been none; the remainder are entered as enfeebled by disease. If they be added to
the number who had no gastro-intestinal derangement, then
we should have 111 cases without this premonitory symptom,
and 125 with it. Let it be observed, we have included all
forms of gastric disorder. Had we confined it to diarrhoea,
we should certainly have had less than-one half who had not
this symptom, which has been called the first stage of cholera, and we should observe that, beyond all doubt, the most
severe cases were those in which it was absent.
We shall now consider the second question suggested by the
Report under review, viz., Is diarrhoea a rare disease, and one
which precedes no other malady but cholera? Fortunately
we have not far to go for a reply to this question; for in the
same Parliamentary Report,' occur the following words:" From returns to inquiries which we addressed to the
medical officers of the metropolitan Unions, with a view to
ascertain the present state of disease in their several districts, and particularly among that portion of the population
in which cholera chiefly prevailed at its last visitation, we
learn that diarrhoea, in some localities, is, at the present
time, co-extensive with typhus, and that in a few it even
predominates. It must be borne in mind that the impure
atmosphere which so powerfully predisposes to cholera, when
that disease is epidemic, predisposes to diarrhoea, whether
cholera be epidemic or not; that diarrhoea is the constant
precursor of typhus, as it was in 1832 of cholera; that
diarrhoea and typhus frequently pass into each other, and
that diarrhoea, like typhus, is never absent from certain undrained and filthy localities, where it divides the reign with
typhus, and produces the like mortality."
Again, in the same Report,t we have a reply to the part of
