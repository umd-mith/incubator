ITS SYMPTOMS.


181


" Pulsat. 3d dil.
"3, P.M.-No change. Voice became a whisper.     Her
words were, ' There will never be ease for me in this world.'
" 8, P.M.-Has been quiet and speechless from 5, P.M. Is
quite insensible. Bowels twice opened. Died at half-past
8, P.M., of the 30th."
The stage of reaction takes place with more or less rapidity.  The more gradual it is the better. It is not necessary to give a detail of the symptoms of this stage, for they
differ only in a few particulars and in degree from the preceding stage. There may be reaction to almost any amount,
from a slight increase of warmth to a complete return of the
pulse, and yet the patient may not recover. In most of the
fatal cases, there was partial reaction; and till we became
conversant with the turns of the disease, we were sadly disappointed to find, after an apparent approach to recovery, a
sudden and almost instantaneous sinking of all the vital
powers. We may give a case in illustration, in which the
pulse reappeared, vomiting and purging ceased, cramps
diminished, and the patient was bathed in warm perspiration, and yet died a few hours after all these favourable
symptoms:"CASE VI.-R. A., aged 30, a man of intemperate habits,
who had been drinking whisky the previous day, but otherwise in his usual health. He was seized with vomiting and
purging and cramps about midnight of the 24th of October;
and when seen at 5 o'clock the next morning, he was found
standing on the floor roaring with pain. His face was pale
and anxious; his lips and breath were quite cold; no pulse
could be felt, and he could not move from where he stood
from the violence of the cramps. Alvine evacuations watery,
what he vomited was tinged with blood.
