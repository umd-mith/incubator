tage), exactly resembling that which takes place in some
persons while reciting their prayers. It continued a short
time after death, and at the same time movements of the
forearm were observed.  These first produced pronation,
which was slowly but with complete regularity followed by
supination-such alternation continuing even for several
minutes. If great care in observation had not been used,
it might easily have been believed that these meteoric motions of the lips and arms were directed by consciousness.
Frequently, a vermicular or oscillatory movement of the muscles of the thorax was discernible.
" The Nervous System.-In several cases the sinuses of the
brain were found remarkably empty; and the veins of the
pia mater were swollen up, though containing but little
blood. The membranes of the brain were not found in the
congested state described by some Indian practitioners; both
the arachnoid and pia mater retained their transparency, the
former containing no fluid, and manifesting some of the
stickiness perceived in the pleura. The ventricles, too, contained less fluid than in the normal state, and the substance
of the brain did not exhibit bloody points on section. The
spinal marrow was examined in almost all cases, and found
in a natural condition, its veins, however, being swollen and
pursed up, without any turgescence from blood, and containing (the author supposes) rarefied air. The various nerves
and ganglia were examined, without furnishing any particular results."
Professor Lizars of Edinburgh, in a pamphlet republished
last year, containing his observations upon the anatomical
appearances of persons who died of cholera, gives the following summary of the examination of the ganglionic system
of nerves in seventeen cases:"In ten, the neurolema of the pneumogastric nerves was
