the subject, which appear at present to have by far the
largest number of adherents, and one of which seems to us
by much the most plausible.
The first opinion is thus stated by the Sanitary Commission in their Report:" Asiatic cholera appears to be caused by a poison diffused
in the atmosphere, which acts with peculiar intensity on the
mucous membrane of the alimentary canal. The irritation
set up in this membrane, in most cases, is not violent at

that the thinner and colourless portion of the blood is poured
out from it with the same rapidity as it would be if a large
opening were made in the great vein of the arm."
MUller mentions that in Berlin, amid the innumerable
theories promulgated in that prolific capital, the one most in
vogue when he was there, in September 1848, (it is probably
obsolete long' ago,) may be thus stated:-Cholera "consisted
in a very acute catarrh of the intestines, combined and essentially associated with certain peculiar symptoms, which were
an extremely rapid transudation of all the fluid parts of
the blood; and in consequence of this, a rapidly developed
paralysis of the nerves."* Broussais says, it is the action of
an unknown agent upon the alimentary canal, which produces "exageration de Faction nervososanguine, et supersecretion muqueuse."t  Or in the language of Dr. Sutherland, that the cholera is a serious hsemorrhage from the

Our objections to this opinion in all its modifications are

would call typal cases of cholera, run their course with little
