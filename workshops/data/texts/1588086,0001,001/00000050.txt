ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.

been at home as a sporadic disease. It was nothing new
there, except in degree. Not so, however, as we trace its
march to the West. Here it entered countries where it had
never been seen before, and brought before the eyes of the
inhabitants of Europe forms of death until then known only
by tradition.
We left the cholera in 1819 at the western borders of
Hindostan; it took two years to cross the intervening district between that and the other great eastern valley of
the river Euphrates. In the summer of 1821, it raged with

the Persian army also appears to have been virtually dissolved. The men dropped off rapidly; and whole troops deserted
to return to their homes; so that when he reached Khooe, he
had scarcely any army to dismiss. The loss by disease was
