some places, as Russia, it seemed to prefer moving always
against the wind.
Although in the present state of meteorology, when we
cannot even predict whether the morrow will be wet or dry,
hot or cold, it would be absurd to expect anything approaching to a scientific reply to the question which every one puts,
-What is it in the air which causes this or any other fatal
epidemic? yet a few positive observations have been made
which seem to establish as a fact, that during the prevalence
of cholera, there often is a disturbance of the ordinary atmospheric phenomena. We shall select a few examples of such
observations; and as the reports about weather are generally
framed in a very loose style, lest we should make bad worse
by giving an incorrect account of these reports, we shall employ the words of the observers themselves. Our first authority is Dr. Prout:
" The matters occasionally diffused through the atmosphere, which appear to be in a state of solution, are not often
perceptible by our senses, unless in some cases, perhaps, by
the sense of smell.
" As an instance of the presence of such bodies in the
atmosphere, we may mention a very remarkable observation
which occurred to the writer of this treatise during the late
prevalence of epidemic cholera. He had for some years
been occupied in investigations regarding the atmosphere;
and for more than six weeks previously to the appearance
of cholera in London, had almost every day been engaged
in endeavouring to determine, with the utmost possible accuracy, the weight of a given quantity of air, under precisely the same circumstances of temperature and of pressure.
On a particular day, the 9th of February 1832, the weight
of the air suddenly appeared to rise above the usual standard. As the rise was at the time supposed to be the result
