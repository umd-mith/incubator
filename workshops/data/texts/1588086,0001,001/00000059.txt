We may be able to arrive only at negative conclusions on
this subject, but that is always nearer the truth than positive error.
Did it advance from India hither by contagion? Let us
first look narrowly at the meaning of the affirmative answer
to this. Supposing one person has a disease, and another
person, previously well, touches him, and takes the same disease, and in his turn, comes in contact with another, and
another, and another, and they all take it, and in their turn
give it to all they meet-then that disease is spreading by
contagion. In doing so, it will tend to spread in circles,
like ripples from a stone thrown into the water, augmenting
as they retire from the original centre of disturbing force.
The circular form will be retained as long as there is surface
enough of water to afford room for a complete circle, and
when it comes in contact with a bank, then the waves will be
in segments of circles. They never can lose altogether their
tendency to a circular character. The same is the case with
a disease which advances by contagion alone. It should
spread in ripples among the population where it first appeared, and gradually enlarge the circumference of its
sphere until it had embraced all who were susceptible of its
influence. The only determining condition would be the
density of the population; it should spread more rapidly in
a dense than a sparse community. It never could spread at
all where there were no people, any more than a fire could
spread without fuel. It would always be found along the
line of human intercourse, and nowhere else. It would go
from place to place with men-whether they went by ships,
by canals, by railway, or go how they would, if it spread by
human contact, they could no more get rid of it than can a
villain get rid of his guilty conscience by change of place.
It would attend man like his shadow. Such are the obvious
