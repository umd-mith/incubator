IS IT CONTAGIOUS?

contagion by residing in a house in Musselburgh, in which
several fatal cases took place. Professor Alison has been so
kind as draw up for me the history of these two cases, in as
far as they bear upon the question of imported contagion;
and I shall here give the communication with which he has
favoured me in his own words, and with his own excellent
prefatory remarks and comments.
" ' It seems to me clear,' hlie observes, ' that the evidence
of the contagious nature of any disease turns ultimately on
a calculation of chances. The question always comes to
this,-Is the circumstance of intercourse with the sick followed by the appearance of the disease, in a proportion of
cases so much greater than any other circumstance common
to any portion of the inhabitants of the place under observation, as to make it inconceivable that the succession of
cases occurring in persons having that intercourse should
have been the result of chance. If so, the inference is unavoidable, that that intercourse must have acted as a cause
of the disease. All observations which do not bear strictly
on that point are irrelevant, and in the case of an epidemic
first appearing in a town or district, a succession of two
cases is sometimes sufficient to furnish evidence, which, on
the principle I have stated, is nearly irresistible.
" ' For example, in the case of Widow Macmillan, in Skinner's Close, it is certain, as the whole town was under medical surveillance at the time, and every one on the watch for

person in Edinburgh or Leith (i. e., in about 160,000 people) who took the disease without having been in the district at Musselburgh, Tranent, &amp;c., where it prevailed; nor
was there any case in Edinburgh or Leith in a person who
had not left thle town for ten days after. And in regard to
this first case of the disease in Mrs. Macmillan originating
