ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


the slightest symptoms of the disease appear. It is useless
if not given within the first few hours. If the Government
would appoint a Commission to inquire into this matter, we
are confident that the evidence adduced would convince it
of the propriety of making a similar recommendation.  But
of this we have little hopes.
We have spoken of the cure of the first stage of cholera,
and the means by which it may be effected; we now come
to speak of the treatment of the second and third stages,
for we cannot separate these two in a therapeutic point of
view.  The transition is immense. The first stage may be
cured by any person who knows the one proper medicine to
give; the next stages require skilful treatment; and even
in the hands of the most judicious and attentive the issue is
often fatal. The difference between the two is like that between the suppression of an evil thought and the undoing
of a wicked deed. The pathology of the disease would itself have led us to this conclusion, independently of experience; for it is quite manifest that a disease in which there
is a disorganization of the blood must be difficult to manage.
The stream of life, which supplies all the materials for the
growth and maintenance of the body, is poisoned, and we
cannot remove the poison, therefore we cannot cure cholera
when it is fully developed. But we can do much to neutralize the bad effects of this poison upon the system, and
thus we can treat the disease much more successfully than
Allopathic practitioners. A patient ill of cholera may be
regarded as a person poisoned; if the poison be very virulent,
he dies; if not, he may recover, if we antidote its physiological effects upon the animal economy by appropriate remedies.
We feel the more called on to make these preliminary observations from remembering our utter despair, when we
first treated the disease, at finding, despite of all our boasted
