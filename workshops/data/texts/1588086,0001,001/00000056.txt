ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


The total number of cases in Moscow was 6305, of which
3533 were fatal. The daily seizures at one time were about
fifty, and the deaths about half that number. About the
same time that it had reached Moscow by one route, it
reached Odessa by another; but generally declined in the
southern provinces of Russia, where it had shown itself during the winter of 1830. Having established itself on the
borders of the Black Sea and Sea of Azof, it began to ascend
the Danube in the winter of 1831, and appeared at Jassi on
the 10th of May. By August it was in Vienna. While one
division was thus penetrating into Europe by the south,
another column, having set all tlhe barricades of the Emperor Nicholas at defiance, forcing its way in a westerly
direction, spread towards St. Petersburg in the north, and
over the Carpatlhian Mountains into Transylvania, and Hungary, and Poland towards the south. It attacked the towns
of Brody and Cracow during that summer, and spread generally over Galicia. In Hungary, it was computed that about
19,000 persons fell sick, of whom 8266 died. We cannot
trace its progress minutely from place to place throughout
the extensive plains of Poland: it seems to have spread
over them as the hordes of barbarians in a former age may
have done, following no geographical lines, but occupying
all the thickly peopled districts.
Advancing to the north, it arrived at St. Petersburg on
the 25th of June; and here it changed its course, and went
down the Gulf of Finland in a south-easterly direction. It
entered Prussia by way of Castrin, Riga, Posen, and Stettin,
and occupied Berlin on the 31st of August 1831; and
about the beginning of October, it made its appearance in
Sunderland.* It made very little way in England during
