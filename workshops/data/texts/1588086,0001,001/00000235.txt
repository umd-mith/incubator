remedies, every patient died. This is a common experience,
and we would warn our brethren to be prepared to find all
their efforts baffled. By and bye, when the cases were not so
rapid, and the poison apparently not so virulent quoad the
persons, the number of our recoveries rapidly increased. So
we would say to others, " Go on treating all you can, and be
not disheartened although they all die; things will mend if
you persevere." We propose now to give a detail of the
various medicines which have been employed in treating the
second and third stages of Cholera; and we shall give an analysis of the symptoms of each medicine which resembles in
its operation those of the disease, and practical commentaries upon its administration. As we look upon this as the
most important and incomplete part of this work, we trust
that those who may acquire experience in the treatment of
the disease may direct their special attention to its correction and completion.
Arsenic is the remedy in which we have far the most faith,
after the period for the administration of camphor is passed.
An attentive study of the operation of arsenic fully warrants this confidence in its curative power in cholera.  It
evidently has a deep action on the vitality of the body, independently altogether of its local irritant effect, and this
action, like that of the cholera poison, shows itself in many
ways, but the most characteristic symptom is simply death.
The following quotation from Dr. Chlristison's exhaustive
treatise upon poisons will bring this out better than anything
else we can collect, and it is confirmed by the observations
of Orfila:" In the Medical and Philosophical Journal of New York
is related the case of a druggist, who swallowed an ounce of
powd(lered arsenic at once, and died in eight hours, after two
