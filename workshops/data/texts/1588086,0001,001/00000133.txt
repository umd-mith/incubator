diarrhcea or gastro-intestinal derangement; for our opinion
at the time we saw them was quite unformed upon this point,
and we were anxious for any facts which bore upon it.
They may be taken as specimens of the cases entered in the
table which we shall afterwards give, as " without gastrointestinal disarrangement." -
" P. M., aged 46, a man of intemperate habits, living in a
close room, with several other persons of both sexes, in a
filthy lane of the Grassmarket, had been in his usual health,
and had no diarrhoea till 5 o'clock, A.M., of the 20th October,
when he was suddenly seized with vomiting and purging.
When seen for the first time at 10, A.M., we found him out
of bed, standing almost naked on the floor; he said he had
risen on account of the violence of the cramps. The surface
of the body was quite cold, the tongue cold, the pulse could
not be felt, the toes were quite turned in by the cramps,
and he complained much of the violent pain in his legs. He
was vomiting and purging a watery fluid.
"He died at a quarter before 10, P.M., seventeen hours
after seizure, and twelve hours after first visit."
" R. A., aged 22, a man of sober, industrious habits, living
in a comfortable room, withoutfeeling unwell, took a dose of
salts and senna as a precautionary measure, on the morning
of the 22d of October, which operated in the course of the
day. At 4, P.M., he was seized with vomiting, purging, and
cramps. When seen at half-past 7, P.M., the surface of the body
was cold and dark blue in colour; the pulse was felt like
the finest thread; the jaw was hanging, and the eyes open,
glassy, and turned up; the tongue and breath were icy cold;
the voice a hollow whisper; there was great thirst, watery
vomiting and purging, and violent cramps in legs and arms.
"He died half-past 1, A.M., of the following morning, nine
hours and a half after seizure, and six hours after first visit."
