The following case of poisoning quoted by Wibmer and
Christison will illustrate the group of symptoms which are
sometimes met with in cholera, and for which this medicine
is adapted: " A thief took forty grains of the pure acid in
dilution, and after staggering a few steps, he sunk without
a groan to the ground. A physician who instantly saw him
found the pulse gone and the breathing for some time imperceptible. After a short time he made so forcible an expiration, that the ribs seemed drawn almost to the spine.
The legs and arms then became cold, the eyes prominent,
glistening, and quite insensible, and after one or two more
convulsive expirations, he died."*
