ITS MARCH.

in some batallions 300 died out of 1000 men; and the rear
of their line of march was strewn with dead bodies, as if it
had been all the way in action!"-almost the words used to
describe the condition of the British army, under the Marquis
of Hastings, in similar circumstances. The description of
the disease at Tabreez, by the same writer, is interesting:
"It is difficult to say how or whence the epidemic cholera,

24th, after a short absence, we understood that from fifteen

revert to the fact afterwards. To continue our description:
