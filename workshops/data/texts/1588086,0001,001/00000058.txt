" Too much stress must not be laid upon these coincidences,
curious as some of them undoubtedly are. Moreover, we find
important exceptions. Odessa and Orenburg, also, both
suffered at periods differing from each other, in the two epidemics.
" In the further progress, there are also some singular
coincidences. Thus cholera appeared at Moscow in the beginning of October 1830; at the end of September 1847.
It appeared at St. Petersburg on the 25th of June 1831;
and in the beginning of June 1848. The first cases occurred
in Berlin on the 31st of August 1831; about the 12th of
August 1848.   In our own country the coincidence has
failed, for cases of cholera have already occurred in places
situated in all parts of the kingdom, from Edinburgh to
Plymouth, within a short space of time."
Having tracked this deadly visitant round half the globe,
we naturally come to inquire by what force it has been impelled, and by what conditions it has been limited or directed.
