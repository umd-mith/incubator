ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


it is with the question now opening to us. In tracing the
march of cholera, we sought as high a point of view as possible, that we might survey an immense extent of the earth's
surface, and estimate aright the strides of the destroying
angel. This was absolutely necessary, when many degrees
of longitude intervened sometimes between his footsteps.
It was like following the course of some mighty conqueror
with a telescope from a point far above the earth. To
determine the important question of the contagiousness of
cholera, we must track it from house to house, from room to
room, from bed to bed. We must prepare ourselves for investigating the most minute particulars, like a police-officer.
The one would be the task of a Fouche, the other that of a
Humboldt.
We want to make out whether the cholera is contagious
or not. Let us first distinctly understand what we mean
by contagious. Suppose a person has got small-pox, and
six other persons attend him, and two of the six on going
home fall ill of small-pox, and six persons attend each
of them in their separate abodes, and again two of each of
the six take the disease likewise, and so on until it is a
notorious fact among the community that a person who has
been in attendance upon another having small-pox, is more
liable to be attacked by the disease than his neighbours,
who do not come in contact with persons so affected; then
we say that small-pox is contagious.
The simple common-sense view of the matter is, that
communication with the sick gives a liability to the particular disease they suffer from. Nobody says that contact
with the sick is the only way of getting the disease, otherwise how did the disease first begin? There must have been a
first case of every disease; and unless we suppose that Adam
on his expulsion from Eden was immediately smitten with
