ITS PATHOLOGY-PREDISPOSING CAUSES.


been too much the practice in dealing with this as with
other points connected with the cholera, to sacrifice rigorous
truth to didactic effort. Were we to believe some well-meaning, but one-ideaed persons, we should conclude that total
abstinence from stimulants would be nothing short of the
harbinger of the millennium-that the cholera, as well as
most other diseases, was sent as a special scourge to drunkards, and that no quiet living, respectable member of a temperance society need be at all alarmed when the cry of

modify this conclusion. Let it be observed that intemperance implies many things-destitution, filth, a wretched

We have seen a drunkard staggering over his dying wife,
vainly attempting to raise her in the bed. That to these
concomitants of drunkenness rather than to the state of the
body directly produced by this hideous vice, are to be attributed the number of the intemperate who perish from
cholera, seems proved by the simple fact, that in India the
proportion attacked is in direct ratio to the poverty of the

which occurs regarding the prevalence of the disease in different classes of people, is, that the higher ranks of society

this seems to hold good through all its branches, military as

population of India on this principle into two classes, in the
