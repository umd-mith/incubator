ITS TREATMENT.


191


In Russia, from the 16th of October 1846, to the 23d of
June 1848, the number of persons attacked by cholera was
200,318, and out of these 116,658 died, giving a mortality
of 57 per cent.*
According to Lasbgne, there is little difference in the mortality in the former and recent epidemic. In Moscow, on
the former occasion, the number of cases was 4461, the
deaths 2425, giving a mortality of about 54 per cent.; so
that we may safely state, that invariably under Allopathic
treatment, the mortality exceeds 50 per cent.
If we find that under HIomeopathic treatment the mortality is invariably less, we think we may be excused entering
into any detail of the various remedies used by the old
school; for even with our better medication, the mortality is
very great, and we are but little disposed to encounter the
certainty of a great increase in the number of deaths. We
propose then adducing proof of the lesser mortality of cholera
under Homoeopathic than under Allopathic treatment, and in
doing so we shall only take a small portion of evidence, but
shall try to sift it well, so that it may be thoroughly relied
on; and we shall call no witnesses but those for whose integrity we can vouch, or who can be shown to be worthy of credit
by the expressed opinions of their opponents.
Although we have stated the general mortality of the
cholera in the last and present epidemic at about 55 per
cent., the number of deaths in hospitals was much greater.
In the Cholera Hospital of Edinburgh during the present
epidemic, out of 230 admitted, 149 died, and only 68 recovered; which in round numbers may be stated thus-that
two out of three die, and one out of three recovers.t
