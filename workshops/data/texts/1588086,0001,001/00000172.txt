ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


whether other morbific influences, which act primarily
through the nervous system, afford any analogy in the
effects they manifest with those which characterize cholera.
As there is a strong tendency at present to revive in a new
form the old humoral pathology, and to deny altogether the
direct action both of morbific and remedial agents upon the
nervous system, we must adduce some proofs of the counterproposition.
In the first place, we shall show that sudden impressions
upon the ganglionic nerves may cause death without anything actually passing into the blood. Lobstein, in his treatise on the sympathetic nerves, makes the following observations:" There are many instances in which injuries inflicted
externally upon the epigastrium have produced death
by their mechanical effects.  1st. The dropping of water
from any height upon the scrobiculus cordis cannot be long
borne. 2d. A boy was killed from being struck by a playmate on the epigastrium with a snow-ball, which left no
visible marks on the organs within. 3d. RUISCH, who during
fifty years taught anatomy at Amsterdam, states that sudden
death may occur from a concussion of the mesenteric nerves
(solar plexus) without the existence of any lesion in them
which can be detected. 4th. An electrical discharge through
the abdomen may cause instantaneous death. This is confirmed by HUMBOLDT, who saw himself the electrical eels,
(Gymnotus Electricus,) when placed under the bellies of horses
and mules, destroy the lives of these animals, by the sudden
emission of their electric fluid. 5th. In the recession of the
miliary exanthemata, by which patients are suddenly destroyed with a development of the severest symptoms, inexpressible anxiety, suffocative asthma, &amp;c., whilst the function of the brain is unimpaired, therc is proof that an im
