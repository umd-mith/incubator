ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


was something unusual about the weather; it was unnaturally hot, cold, wet, or stormy. Dr. Orton, who strongly advocates this opinion, has collected a number of testimonies
in favour of this belief. We may quote some of the most
striking:" The epidemic appeared and prevailed in its greatest violence at Bombay in the latter part of August. Mr. Jukes,
who was stationed at Tannah, on the island of Salsette, and
about twenty miles from the town of Bombay, in a letter to
the Medical Board, observes:-' In order to afford you every
information in my power, I will just add, that to common observation there has been nothing very particular in the state
of the weather. The barometer has neither been particularly
high nor low. The thermometer, for the last month, has
scarcely ranged more than from 75~ to 82~, and many days
nearly stationary at 78~ or 79~. Leslie's hygrometer, according to the days, has ranged from 8~ to 20~. The fall of rain
in August was unusually great; measured by Howard's pluviometer, we had upwards of forty-eight inches.' Some
idea may be formed of this enormous quantity of rain, when
it is recollected, that even in the rainy climate of Great
Britain, not more than thirty-two inches, on the average,
fall annually. The Bombay Gazette of September 30, likewise mentions, that thunderstorms of unusual violence had
occurred there of late. Accounts from Surat and Broach
also lament the damage done there by the 'unusual fall of
