ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


tions as the secondary effects. This seems to be exactly
what happens in cholera. When the poisonous agent is very
potent and malignant, very speedy death takes place with
few general symptoms. When the poison is weaker, then we
have a great number, and a great variety of symptoms. We
might say, that the only essential symptom of cholera was
death; that all the other symptoms were merely concomitant. The most important morbid impressions are propagated along the various nervous tracks which freely inosculate with the ganglionic system. The influence traverses
the respiratory nerves which supply the heart and lungs,
and the patient's first definite sensation of disease is connected with the heart. The exclamations, " Oh, my heart!"
and " my heart is bursting!" and " something is wrong with
my heart!" we have heard repeatedly from persons ill of
cholera. This influence produces a sense of extreme depression at the heart, or an intolerable load there. It destroys
the function of the lungs; the breath comes from the chest
as cold as it enters; respiration goes on, but no effects are
evident, and it is like the mechanical breathing of a corpse.
The consequence of this is that the blood does not undergo
the requisite changes. It is no longer purified and arterialized in the lungs, but continues dark and venous, and thus
gives the livid colour so characteristic of the disease. Having acquired no heat in its transit through the lungs, it can
give none to the rest of the body, which remains deadly cold.
All secretion requires a certain nervous influence, and this
being at an end, or perverted, the different organs cease to
perform their functions. The matters which should be eliminated from the blood remain in it, so that not only is
there no purification at the lungs, but all the other impurities of the body accumulate in this " pabulum vitce." Instead of secretion we have discharges. The withdrawal of the
