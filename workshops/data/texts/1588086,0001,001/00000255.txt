Drouard relates that twenty-one Jacobin friars were poisoned by a preparation of copper, and that " in all of them
the first symptoms were severe headaches, accompanied with
excessive weakness in the legs and in the whole body; dull
pains over the forepart of the thighs, and, in some, cramps
in the calves of the leg. Those who first felt the action of
the poison had experienced besides a severe pain in the
stomach, accompanied with great anxiety of the precordia,
which is peculiar to it, and a trembling of the limbs."*
It will be seen by these cases that vomiting and purging
are by no means a constant effect of copper; but pain and
cramps seem to be so. We shall now give the symptoms
of cuprum metallicum and cuprum aceticum, as we have done
