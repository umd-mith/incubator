committed dreadful ravages before night. It is therefore evidently of the highest importance to ascertain the state of the
atmosphere on that memorable day. Mr. Allardyce, the surgeon of the regiment, reports to the Medical Board:-' During the whole of the day of the 21st, the weather was unusually close and excessively oppressive, with a clear sun.
At 10, P.M., we had a violent thunderstorm, with two hours

a question (notwithstanding the protracted prevalence of the
epidemic in various parts of India) as yet undetermined, what
its predisposing causes are. Various opinions have been
given, but all of them admit of unanswerable objections.
That, however, some peculiar state of the atmosphere has

October, thirty inches of rain are stated from good authority
to have fallen, when during the same period in former years
from three to five inches have been the average quantity.
Added to this material change in the seasons, the ahnos
