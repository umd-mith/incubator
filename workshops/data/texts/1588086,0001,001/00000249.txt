recorded in Hahnemann, which justify its use in cholera, we
shall give a very good example of the poisonous effects of the
drug. We may mention in passing, that it is one of the
oldest poisons, and is supposed to have been used by the Gauls
and other nations in their gallant warfare with the Romans.
So that to it Horace probably alludes in his famous ode, in
which he introduces the " vneenatis gravida sagittis." This
rests on the authority of Pliny, Celsus, and Dioscorides.*
The following case, quoted by Orfila, is related by Vicat:t
-" A tailor, his wife, children, and workman, took some soup
in which the root of white hellebore had been put instead of
pepper. Shortly after, these persons were seized with a general coldness, and their bodies became covered with an icy
sweat; their debility was extreme; they were almost in a
state of insensibility; and their pulse could scarcely be perceived. At the expiration of two hours, the eldest child,
who was not four years of age, began to vomit copiously, but
with considerable straining. The rest were shortlyafterin the
same condition." The next case is recorded by Briickmann,+
and quoted by Wibmer:-" A woman, sixty years of age, had
taken some powdered hellebore-root by mistake. After an
hour had elapsed, she was affected with violent burning in the
throat and stomach; nausea; she began to retchgreenmucus;
she had dysuria (Harnzwang); stiffness and coldness of the
whole body; the pulse was imperceptible; the perspiration
occasionally interrupted; often spasmodic; the face pale;
the pupils enlarged; sensibility and consciousness were absent."
The following catalogue of symptoms are extracted from
Hahnemann's proving, and we have marked those we wish
to direct attention to as we did the symptoms of arsenic:* Wibmer, op. cit., v. Band S. 406.
