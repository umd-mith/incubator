ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


melancholy, and the most mortifying thing of all is, that,
under every method of treatment hitherto pursued, in any
quarter of the world, the average rate of mortality of cholera
continues much the same-certainly not diminished, perhaps
rather augmented. We possess no means of judging correctly of the relative mortality from cholera, as it may be
affected by climate. To attain that object, we should have
returns of the cases of cholera occurring amongst the natives
of India of all classes, in several districts, towns, or villages,
to contrast with similar returns in Europe. The chief difficulty, however, in India, would be the incorrectness of such
returns, not much dependence being placed on the judgment
or fidelity of the native doctors, or the native revenue servants, usually employed on that duty. The only return of
this description which seems entitled to consideration, relates
to an extensive district to the northward of Madras. It exhibits an aggregate of 14,723 cases, yielding 4345 deaths,
scarcely 30 per cent. In some villages, the mortality rose
to 89 in 100, 10 in 13, 48 in 70, 99 in 143, when there was
either no medical aid, or when it was refused. In the principal-town, where the European medical officer resided, and
where classification would be more correct, the rate was 40
per cent. The returns in this country, at present published
by the Board of Health, are generally said to be incorrect,
and not to exhibit the numbers actually seized with cholera.
If, however, they give a true account of the events of the
cases entered, it is sufficient for our present purpose. Now,
up to 22d February, these returns give 12,621 cases, 5595
deaths, 3840 recoveries, and 3186 remainders, which exhibits a ratio of mortality of only 44 per cent.; but, taking
this per centage of 44 out of the remainders, 3186, it yields
1400 to be added to the deaths, and the real rate of mortality will be found to be at least 55 per cent."
