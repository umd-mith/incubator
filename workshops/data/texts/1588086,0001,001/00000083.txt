IS IT CONTAGIOUS?

Protestants to ascribe this exemption to any miraculous interference in behalf of the inmates on account of their
superior sanctity; and therefore can find no other reason
than that they had no communication with those affected
with plague. We must remember that at that period the
number of "religieuses" in France was immense. It was
before her expurgation-to use the term employed in describing the clearing of a town from the plague.
The exemption of the convents from the plague forms a
contrast between it and the cholera, as we observed that one
of the first cases of cholera at Moscow was in a convent; as
also the great tract of intermediate country which remained
free of all infection. The plague follows the line of human
intercourse, and when that line is in the sea, which cannot
be infected by the troubles of man, it strikes root the moment it touches land. It colonizes-going from port to port.
It does not sweep over vast districts, like an inundation of
barbarous hordes.
Although the plague is undoubtedly a disease which requires human intercourse to spread it, yet that is not sufficient of itself. The fuel must be prepared, or the spark
falls in vain. It spreads only at particular seasons, and in
particular places. We have given an example of its arrival
at a place where all was ready for its reception, and where
its triumph was instantaneous. We shall now give one of
its arrival at a place where it made slow progress at first,
and had difficulty in effecting a footing. This is the intermediate link between such a place as Marseilles and the
rest of France, which at that time was not infected at all.
Our example shall be the island of Cyprus,* in 1759.

at Alexandria, and bound for Constantinople, was wrecked
