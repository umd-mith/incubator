ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


at stomach, a sudden death-like countenance, cessation of all
the pulses: these, and other striking characteristics of this
fearful disease, marked the fatal cases, and terminated in
death.
" Often when the disease was at its height, the first seizure,
indicated by vertigo, proved fatal at once. Several instances
came to our knowledge of persons thus attacked in the
streets, who fell down senseless, and never recovered."*
About the same time that the cholera raged along the
shores of the Persian Gulf, it appeared at Mecca, Medina,
Damascus, and Aleppo, having spread over a great part of
Arabia. Its rapid progress across the desert is of remarkable interest. It takes months or even years to get over a
mountain range, traversed by thousands of people with all
their merchandise, and it crosses the great Arabian desert,
where a human being is seldom seen, and all is death and
stillness, in a space of time unappreciable from its shortness.
The eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, and the
western shores of the Caspian, formed the extreme limits of
its progress in 1823; and it then subsided entirely, and as it
was hoped for ever. Nothing now was known of it for six
years, so that it was not till 1829 that it suddenly broke out
with its former violence in various parts of Persia. Again
it subsided entirely during the winter months, but only to.
revive with great malignancy in the spring of 1830.
It broke out on the western shore of the Caspian Sea in
June 1830, and committed great devastation in Georgia,
confining itself chiefly to the towns situated along the valley
of the river Kur, and extending by the beginning of August
from Saliany, which is at the mouth of that river, to Tiflis,
which is near the source. In this latter town, 238 persons
died of it in six days, and the authorities gave the inhabi.
