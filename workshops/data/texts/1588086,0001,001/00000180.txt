ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


death, however, it remained as placed, just as would so much
moulded clay. The skin of the fingers was thus thrown
into plaits without the mechanical intervention of any
foreign body. The author explains the occurrence by the
removal of the aqueous portions of the blood from the cutaneous capillaries, leaving only a pasty plastering on their
surface; and-he believes this passive condition of the skin
to act as a preservative against the communication of the
disease by contact-differing so entirely as it does from the
turgescence of the surface observable in yellow fever. The
skin of the forehead, which was violaceous, pasty, and plaited prior to death, had frequently recovered its natural colour
when the body was brought in for dissection.     In this
disease, says A. Beclard, the living resemble the dead,
and the dead the living. In respect to the eyes, M. Bally
observes:" ' Who does not recollect the frightful aspect of the unfortunate beings suffering under the algide period? How.
astonished and stupified their air, what uncertainty in their
looks! Was ever a more painful spectacle seen than the
globes of the eye coloured by numberless delicate arborizations, often giving rise to bloody patches; or those horrible
stigmata blackening the sclerotica exposed to view by the
convulsive expansion of the eyelids? The sclerotica, too,
acquired a demi-transparency due to its partial desiccation,
which allowed the blackness of the choroid to be seen
through it. During the apogee of this period, a rapid disappearance of the fat of the orbit, and a notable resorption of
the aqueous humour of the two chambers and of the interior
of the tissues took place. At the same time, the muscles,
finding no longer the same resistance in a globe so diminished in volume, drew back the organ into the very depths
of the orbit. It might be said, and the remark would apply
