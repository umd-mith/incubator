ITS TREATMENT-PHOSPHORUS.. 265


Extremities.-Rheumatic drawing in left foot, extending
to the ball of the big toe.
Phosphorus and Phosphoric Acid are valuable medicines,
both in the painless diarrhoea which precedes cholera, and
also in the latter stage of the disease before it passes into
the typhoid state. The most prominent symptom at this
period is frequently great oppression of the breathing; the
respiration is heaving, and the patient complains of the
intolerable load upon the chest. We have seen phosphorus
give relief, although temporary, in this painful condition;
and we should recommend it to be given in pretty strong
and repeated doses.
