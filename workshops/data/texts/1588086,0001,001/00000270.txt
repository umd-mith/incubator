ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


the toe by a snake which appeared to be a Cobra di capello.
A few drops of blood issued from the part, and he was instantly sensible of pain. When he came to me about half
an hour after the accident, the pain had advanced as high as
the joint of his knee. I immediately prepared and gave him
one of the snake-pills as directed, and that no part of the
prescription should be omitted, the liver of a frog was applied to the wound. In the course of ten minutes after
giving the first pill, the pain had got to the top of his thigh,
and became much more severe. I then gave two more pills,
and ordered a bottle of Madeira to be warmed. Of this he
drank about two cupfulls, but part only remained in his
stomach. The patient now complained of severe pain in his
belly, which on examination appeared to be tense and much
swelled. A sense of tension or tightness spreading fast towards the breast, and respiration becoming extremely laborious, an attempt was made to make him take two more
pills, but deglutition being impeded, a part of them only
reached the stomach, and was immediately rejected. From
this time the stricture of the oesophagus increased so much,
that nothing could be forced down his throat; lie foamed at
the mouth; his eye stood staring and fixed; his pulse and
respiration became hardly perceptible; in short, every vital
motion seemed at a stand.  I applied spirits of hartshorn
to his mouth and nostrils, by which in a few minutes, a
strong sneeze being excited, hlie began to breathe and said
'better.' After he recovered a little, hlie told me he felt the
pain descending retrograde, in the same track in which it
had arisen, and wished for sleep. He slept for half an hour,
and on awaking vomited plentifully. He had now recovered
his senses, and said he only felt a little pain in his toe, and
in two hours he was able to walk home, but did not recover
his fatigue for some days.
