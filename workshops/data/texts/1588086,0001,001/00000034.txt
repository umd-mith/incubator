colour; this increased by degrees, and it became putrid and
offensive to the taste; sick persons avoided drinking from
it, and drank well-water. By boiling, its smell and taste became worse. There also appeared in it worms and other
animals which live in stagnant water." (In De Sacy, on
Abdollaliph, p. 332.) Again, in 1673, the Nile reddened in
July, and continued so till December. (Ib. p. 346.) The
plague consisted in the excessive degree of reddening and
putridity. The ordinary amount of impurity was removed
by putting the water into vessels of wood and stone, whereby
a deposit took place, and the water above became clear; but
in this instance it remained red and blood-like in all the
vessels of the Egyptians.
The second plague-that of the frogs-is simply a greatly
increased number of those animals, which, by all accounts,
are generally abundant enough in Egypt. In some parts of
Italy we have seen frogs in such swarms on the dry ground
that it was almost impossible to set down the foot without
crushing some of them. " In the summer of 1831, I often observed immense flocks, if I may use the term, of young toads
in the vicinity of Sunderland, which I pointed out to several

very painful. They are most abundant after the rice harvest,
that is, at the end of the inundation of the Nile, and would
naturally be increased by an excessive extent of flooded land.
The fourth plague was that of the flies. These, too, torment
the inhabitants of Egypt even yet to a great extent. One
traveller says: " The most numerous and troublesome insects
