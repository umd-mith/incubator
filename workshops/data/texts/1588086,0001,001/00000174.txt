ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


respiration, anxiety, pain at the heart, inquietude, debility,
faintness, convulsion, appearances of the urine, perspiration, vomiting, looseness, and heemorrhage. The symptoms registered
under many of these kinds are common to plague and cholera,
and the points of likeness are more important than those in
which they differ. We have mentioned the almost constant
complaint that cholera patients make-of anxiety, and of
something being wrong at the heart. So striking a symptom
of cholera is this, that Dr. Markus, who saw a great deal of
the disease in Moscow, considers the heart as the primary
seat of the disease, and gives a curious comparative table of
" the symptoms of cholera and those of the morbid affections
of the heart." *  In the plague, says Russell,t " the sick
showed how severely they suffered, by perpetually changing
posture in hopes of relief; but when asked where the pain
lay, they either answered hastily they could not tell, or, with
a fixed, wild look, exclaimed, Kulbi! Kulbi! (My heart!
My heart!)"
Is it not probable that the plague is produced by a poison
acting, as well as the cholera poison, upon the ganglionic system of nerves, being conveyed to the seat of these nerves
through the medium of the respiratory apparatus, and producing symptoms so far resembling cholera as the primary
seat of the disease is similar, and so far differing as the exciting cause of the two is different?
To conclude, all we can say is, that of the many hypothetical causes suggested as the proximate cause of cholera, a
morbid action in the ganglionic system of nerves seems to
us by much the most probable and satisfactory.
