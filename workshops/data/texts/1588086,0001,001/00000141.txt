laxative medicines alternately for weeks together, till delirium tremens comes on, which, in our opinion at least, is a
worse disease than cholera. We are not stating hypothetical cases. We know such cases have occurred. This has
happened especially to females approaching their confinement, and in some instances has rendered this simple and
natural process one of extreme danger, distress, and anxiety;
we believe it has even produced fatal consequences.
But suppose the diarrhoea, for which we have been so assiduously giving our opiate confection and brandy, should happen to be the precursor, not of cholera, but of scarlet or
typhus fever, what would be the consequence? Let any
hospital physician be asked whether he would consider the
risk from these diseases augmented or lessened by the patient having previously taken large quantities of brandy and
opium? We are not putting an imaginary case, but what
we ourselves have seen; for example, when the cholera was
at its height in Edinburgh on the 30th of November, we
were sent for to see a little boy of eleven years old, who was
reported to be ill of it. We saw him at four o'clock in the
afternoon; he had been quite well till ten o'clock that
morning, when he was suddenly seized with watery purging
and vomiting; his pulse was 140, and weak; hlie was giddy;
his tongue was natural, and of the usual temperature. Here
was a case of incipient cholera surely, and proper for opium
and brandy, which, however, we did not'give. At nine, P.M,
his pulse was lower, and he had vomited less. On the following evening he was covered with a red eruption, and the
usual symptoms of scarlet fever appeared. He recovered.
We may state the case thus for the popular understanding:
Typhus fever, scarlet fever, and cholera, all begin occasionally with looseness of the bowels. This looseness is sometimes cured by opium and brandy, but neither the typhus
