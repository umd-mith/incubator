ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.

or less degree with electric fluid, and thunderstorms have
succeeded each other almost in nightly succession. The
thermometer has shown, during the year, a greater alteration in heat and cold than has been known for a long tinle.'
" On the 24th of October, when the epidemic was at its

regard to the epidemic; these hopes appeared to have been
realized, as we are happy to find, that in parts of Madras
where there were numerous cases ten days ago, there are
scarcely any; and that this favourable change has taken
place in consequence of the alteration in the atmosphere produced by the storm, is no unfair conclusion.'"
After many other examples of a similar kind, Dr. Orton
adds:
" If to this mass of positive evidence be added the negative proof, that in all my experience, and in all the researches which I have made into this part of the subject, I

weather which usually occupies so large a portion of the year
in India, to such an extent as to be termed epidemical, surely
