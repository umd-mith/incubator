ITS PATHOLOGY-PREDISPOSING CAUSES.

this pestilence again return, the first and essential precaution is instantly to stop looseness of the bowels. The means
of accomplishing this are simple, if the proper remedies are
employed immediately the looseness comes on; and the proper remedies are aromatic, opiate, and astringent medicines;
twenty grains of the opiate confection, for example, taken in
peppermint water, weak brandy and water, or the common
chalk mixture, and repeated every hour until the relaxation
of the bowels ceases. By this simple remedy, if employed in
this early stage, the evidence adduced justifies the expectation that the progress may generally be arrested of a malady
which, if allowed to advance unchecked to its second stage, is
the most fatal and intractable disease known; in the treatment of which the most opposite modes of practice-the most
powerful and the most inert remedies-bleeding, brandy,
opium, calomel, ammonia, quinine, croton oil, cold water, the
warm bath, the cold affusion, all varieties and contrarieties
of treatment possible, have been employed alike in vain."
As we might expect, the popular instinct soon strips this
passage of its euphuism, and for opiate confection, weak
brandy and water, peppermint water, and chalk mixture,
reads, opium and brandy-the simple remedy, which it is
quite plain the Commissioners had in their eye. In Scotland, however, where brandy is dear and whisky is cheap,
they take the liberty of altering the recipe of the Commission to suit the necessities of the case.
If it were quite certain that opium and brandy really prevented cholera, we cannot but think that a wise legislature
should have hesitated before recommending for popular use
drugs, an indulgence in which is so ruinous to the health,
and whose operation is of so fascinating a nature, that if
once allowed to become a habit, it requires superhuman
self-control to break the destructive thraldom.
