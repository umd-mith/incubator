ITS TREATMENT.

advantageous to the success of the trial, as many were received who had already been dosed with violently acting
medicines and spirituous domestic remedies, and thus were
rendered comparatively insusceptible to the influence of my
small doses, I cannot refrain from stating as my inward
conviction, that the Homoeopathic is the best mode of treatment of the cholera, until at least reflection, experience, or
accident suggest a better method."
We perceive from this table that out of 732 persons admitted, 488 were restored to their friends, and 244 were
carried out dead. Suppose that these 732 had been taken
to an Allopathic hospital, what would have been their fate?
We have every reason to believe, that of the 488 whom we
find returning to their homes, one-half would have been left
behind among the dead. We cannot wonder at the Austrian
Government, although about the most bigoted in Europe,
shrinking from the responsibility of prohibiting a mode of
practice which proved itself to be so much more successful in
the dreadful plague which was as destructive to its subjects
then, as Kossuth and Bern seem to be to its soldiers now.
The only other hospitals that we know of, in which Homoeopathic treatment was employed during the former epidemic, were one at Berlin under Drs. Heynel and Stiiler, and
one at Bourdeaux under Dr. Mabit. In the former out of
32 cases there were 6 deaths, and in the latter, the same
number of deaths out of 31 cases. We mention this for its
historic interest, as the numbers are too small to afford data
for any calculation; so far as they go, however, they confirm the results of the Vienna hospital.
In the present epidemic the only notice we have of the
results of Homceopathic treatment is in Dr. Miiller's Report
regarding the cholera in Petersburgh. He says, " The results of Homceopathy have on the whole here not been unfortunate, and on that account it has been partially imitated
