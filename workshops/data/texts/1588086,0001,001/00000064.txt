ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


of some accidental error, or of some derangement in the apparatus employed, in order to discover its cause, the succeeding observations were made with the most rigid scrutiny;
but no error or derangement whatever could be detected. On
the days immediately following, the weight of the air still
continued above the standard, though not quite so high as
on the 9th of February, when the change was first noticed.
The air retained its augmented weighlit during the whole
time these experiments were carried on, namely, about six
weeks longer. The increase of the weight of the air observed in these experiments was small; but still decided
and real. The method of conducting the experiments was
such as not to allow of an error, at least to an amount so
great as the additional weight, without the cause of that
error, having become apparent. There seems, therefore, to
be only one mode of rationally explaining this increased
weight of the air at London in February 1832, which is,
by admitting the diffusion of some gaseous body through
the air of this city, considerably heavier than the air it
displaced. About the 9th of February, the wind in London,
which had previously been west, veered round to the east,
and remained pretty steadily in that quarter till the end of
the month. Now, precisely on the change of the wind, the
first cases of epidemic cholera were reported in London; and
from that time the disease continued to spread. That the
epidemic cholera was the effect of the peculiar condition of
the atmosphere, is more perhaps than can be safely maintained; but reasons which have been advanced elsewhere,
lead the writer of this treatise to believe that the virulent
disease, termed Cholera, was owing to the same matter that
produced the additional weight of the air."
Dr. Clamnny, " Medical Member of the Board of Health" at
London, writes in 1831:-" We had several severe thunder
