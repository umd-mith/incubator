stealing it during the night. The report says:" It (i.e., fever) is found generally in tenements kept

" According to the experience of the above tables, they
show that out of every hundred cases of cholera that have
occurred in the Town proper, 35 have happened where the
town's water is used, 17 have died, and 18 recovered; and
65 cases have occurred in properties where the town's water
is not used, 41 have died, and 23 recovered. It must, however, be kept in view, that the landlords of a number of the
