ITS PATHOLOGY-MORBID ANATOMY,


which we have made the following extracts. M. Bally had
extensive opportunities of investigating the subject at the
Hotel Dieu of Paris.
He divides the disease into the cyanic and reactionary
period, and the following description is of those who died in
the former stage:
"The surface of the body.-The cyanosis, which may occur at very different periods prior to death, is not the result
of engorgement, but of a deprivation of the watery parts of
the blood. It is very variable in extent and intensity, and
difficult of exact pictorial delineation.  It is rare to find it
quite uniform and general. In the algide form of cholera,
it is by no means rare to find portions of the body having
after death a higher temperature than they possessed during
life. The cadaveric odour was long in becoming developed;
a strong smell from some of the remaining alvine discharges,
resembling the odour of the pollen of the chesnut-flower,
was, however, observable. This smell was often strong and
remarkable; and although it was also very perceptible on
opening the intestines, it in nowise resembled that of fsecal
matters. The faces, too, were long retained without undergoing putrefaction. Otto of Breslau exposed the bodies of
an old man and young woman dying of cholera for three
days to the rays of the sun, and yet was the rigidity as great
as at first, no putrefaction having occurred. The emaciation
was as remarkable during the short space of time that
elapses in cholera, as it is in the longer one of phthisis; and
the bodies of the patients were lifted by the dissecting-room
attendants with astonishing facility. The very singular condition of the skin was sometimes observed, termed by the
author empdtement. In well-marked cyanosis, it might be
seen towards the decline of life; but then the skin, if pinched
up, would slowly, by its elasticity, resume its form. After
