ITS MARCH.

that year, and had entirely subsided by the 2d of January
1832.
Having traced the cholera thus far to its invasion of our
own island, we shall not follow it any further in Britain, but
return to the Continent of Europe.
It broke out in Paris upon the 27th of March 1831, and from
that date to the beginning of August it had attacked 26,300
persons. The total number of persons attacked in France,
where it spread generally in 1833, destroying the fish and
the fowls as well as the human race, was estimated at
229,534 individuals, of whom 94,626 died.
It did not reach Marseilles and Toulon till 1835.*
We have nowwith considerable minuteness traced the march
of the cholera from the banks of the Ganges to the shores of
the North Sea; and before offering any general reflections
upon the facts we have brought together, we shall' advert to
the course of the epidemic on its recent occurrence; and we
shall do this very shortly, for it would serve no purpose to
go over exactly the same ground we have just quitted. In
the words of a writer in the British and Foreign Medical
Review for January 1849:"The disease always followed frequented routes and
water-courses on which navigation was active, equally in
1847 as in 1830. The governments which were most exempt in 1830-31 were this time also less severely attacked.
" In the winter, the cholera lessened or disappeared; it
reappeared with the first warmth of spring. In all these
particulars the cholera of 1847 has manifested a singular
conformity with the laws which seemed to govern it in 1830.
In comparing the dates of attack in different governments, in
the two epidemics, some verystriking analogies are discovered.
