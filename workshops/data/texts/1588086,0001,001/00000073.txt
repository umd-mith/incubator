all the most intolerable. In her case, the experiment was
tried in the afternoon, while with Mdlle. Nowotny, it was in
tlhe forenoon.
" 66. Mdlle. Reichel also perceived a very marked difference: and as the author found her bed in the position from
south to north, he recommended a change to that from north
to south. From this change she derived much benefit, her
rest being much improved.
" 67. Mdlle. Atzmansdorfer, on two occasions, one in the
morning, the other in the evening, could only bear the position from north to south, and found that from west to east
the most disagreeable.
" 68. All these patients now recollected how painful and
disagreeable it had always been for them to remain in church,
although they could never tell why. But as all Catholic
churches are built from east to west, those in front of the
altar are necessarily in the position from west to east, which
to all sensitive persons is the most intolerable. In fact,
these patients, in that position, had often fainted and been
carried out of church. At a later period, Mdlle. Nowotny
could hardly ever bear to walk in the garden or on the street
from west to east, if it lasted for some time.
"69. Thus, eight different cases of sensitive individuals
agreed in this, that every other position, except that from
north to south, is highly disagreeable, but that from west to
east almost intolerable, at least in our hemisphere. Probably in the southern hemisphere it is otherwise. The cause
of these phenomena can obviously be found only in that great
magnet which is formed by the earth with its atmosphere,
that is, terrestrial magnetism. Like any other magnet, the
earth interferes, and we thus arrive at the following law:
The terrestrial magnetism exerts on certain persons, both
healthy and otherwise, who are sensitive, a peculiar influence,
powerful enough to disturb their rest, and in the case of dis
