its connexion with the opposite state of the atmosphere cannot longer remain in the smallest degree doubtful."
We have said that the impression on the minds of almost
all observers was, that there was something unusual in the
weather. We do not know whether or not this impression
has been corroborated by scientific observations. There is
considerable ambiguity in the following passage, which we
quote from Mr. Scot's recent Report, and as the tables he
refers to are not published, we are at a loss to understand
what his meaning is, and whether the conclusion he seems
to arrive at be warranted by the facts or not; for it must be
a most laborious and wearisome task to go through a series of
meteorological tables extending over a period of six years,
and derived, we presume, from many different parts of India.
In quoting the passage, we shall omit the tables which give
the per centage of natives and Europeans who were sick in
different years, and satisfy ourselves with giving his general
results.
" In order to afford the most ample information respecting
the phenomena of the weather, and their effects on the
health of the troops, a series of meteorological tables, and
of tables of diseases, from the year 1815 to 1821, are given
in the Appendix. A certain intemperature of the atmosphere may perhaps be inferred from the results of the tables
of diseases; but its nature will not, it is apprehended, be
very readily discoverable in the sensible changes of the
weather.
" The general health of the European troops would appear
to be restored, in 1822 and 1823, nearly to what it was in
1815 and 1816. The increase of sickness in 1817 is about
15 per centum; but in 1818 to 1821, the increase, independently of cholera, is very considerable, and is not to be
explained by the movements of troops during these years.
