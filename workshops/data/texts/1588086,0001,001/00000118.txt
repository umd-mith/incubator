ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


same manner as we have bisected the year, it is probable
that we should find the less fortunate half affected in the
same proportion to the rest, as are the six summer months
compared with those in which the sun is on the other side
of the line. Thus we constantly find that the officer suffers
less than the soldier or the sepoy; that the superior description of troops, as the cavalry, &amp;c., (who form the elite of the
