ease, which consists of two stages-first, of this, the stage of
simple diarrhoea; and secondly, of the stage of collapse, or
blue stage, to which alone the name of the disease, Asiatic
Cholera, is commonly applied, all the symptoms characteristic of the malady being present only in this stage.
" The first stage, or that of simple diarrhoea, may continue from a few hours to two, three, or more days.  If proper remedies are employed at this period, the progress of the
disease is generally and easily checked, and the second stage
never comes on; but if neglected, the second stage commences suddenly, with all the violence which distinguishes
this dreadful malady. But this suddenness is merely apparent; the disease has been actually present, and has been
making progress several hours, perhaps days, and it is the
second, the violent, the unmanageable, and mortal stage that
has really come on suddenly.
" Any deviation, then, on the side of looseness, from the
natural state of the bowels, during the prevalence of Asiatic
cholera, is the real commencement of that disease; a single
additional evacuation daily, beyond what is natural to the
constitution, nay, even a looser state of the daily evacuation
must, under such circumstances, be so regarded.
" Asiatic cholera appears to be caused by a poison diffused
in the atmosphere, which acts with peculiar intensity on the
mucous membrane of the alimentary canal. The irritation
set up in this membrane, in most cases, is not violent at
first; but if it be allowed to continue unchecked many hours,
it produces such an extraordinary change in the membrane,
that the thinner and colourless portion of the blood is poured
out from it with the same rapidity as it would be if a large
opening were made in the great vein of the arnm.
