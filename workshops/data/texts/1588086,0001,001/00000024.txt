" Cyprus lost almost all its inhabitants; and ships without
crews were often in the Mediterranean, as afterwards in the
North Sea, driving about and spreading the Plague wherever
they went."* " It was reported to Pope Clement at Avignon,
that, exclusive of China, twenty-three millions and upwards
had fallen victims to the Plague throughout the East." Sixty
thousand died at Florence; a hundred thousand at Venice;
a hundred thousand at London; fifty thousand at Norwich.
Many towns were bereft of their inhabitants. " When the
Plague -ceased, men thought they were still wandering among
the dead, so appalling was the livid aspect of the survivors,
in consequence of the anxiety they had undergone, and the
unavoidable infection of the air." Is it possible for us to
realize the horrors of such scenes? In ordinary times, death
is the exception-life the rule; all signs of death are immediately removed; and although it is continually occurring,
it is as quickly concealed. But when death becomes the
rule, and life the exception, how inconceivably awful must
be the feeling!  If solitary confinement deprive a man of
reason, what must it be to be left the solitary tenant of a
city or a ship? The mind cannot take in the horror and
loneliness of so frightful a condition. To be alive amid
silence and corruption-surely the most agonizing form of
death would be less terrible than to live in such a tomb. No
wonder, we repeat, that those who looked on such plagues
found nothing in them of any interest except the results.
To us, however, who can calmly contemplate fatal epi* This recalls to one's mind the scene of " the ancient mariner," and may
have given the hint to the poet Campbell, who, in his picture of horrors which
must environ the last of the race, "who shall creation's face behold, as Adam
saw its prime," describes how
ships were drifting with the dead,
To shores where all was dumb.
