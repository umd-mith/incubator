IS IT CONTAGIOUS?

all infectious diseases-which is hardly compatible with his
maintaining himself and Eve by his exertions, and founding
a family which has lasted for six thousand years-some one
of the human race must have become spontaneously ill of
a disease which afterwards he gave to his neighbours.
Here, then, is the first stumblingblock-a disease may
be contagious, and yet arise without contagion. There is
little doubt that typhus fever is contagious, and as little that
it attacks persons in certain localities who have not been
exposed to contagion.
The next ambiguity we encounter is, that contagion is
almost never universal. If it were so our race would have
been extinct long ago. Only certain persons are liable even
to the most contagious diseases. There are many examples
of heroic exposure to " the plague," both by physicians and
priests, many of whom escaped the disease; so that we can
hardly conceive a more senseless proceeding than experimenting on oneself with a disease reputedly infectious; as
for example, wearing the clothes of persons who had died of
cholera, or sleeping in the bed of a cholera patient, and then
if no bad consequences followed, holding that up as a proof
that the disease is not contagious. It only proves that the
very foolish individual happened not to be liable to its influence.
We start then with these preliminary assertions, that diseases of the most certainly contagious character occur without contagion, and that all persons are not liable to any, even
the most virulent contagion.
Before investigating the facts which bear upon the contagion of cholera, we propose giving a summary of those
which bear upon the contagion of plagues, that we may
have a sort of model before our eyes; and for this purpose
we shall take as an example the plague at Marseilles, in the
