MORBID ANATOMY.
The morbid anatomy of cholera has been investigated by
many able pathologists, and on the whole there is a great
concurrence in the description of the appearances found on
dissection. We may begin with the observations upon the
cholera in India. Mr. Scot says:*-" The external appearance of European subjects who have sunk under cholera,
closely resembles that which has been noticed as taking
place during life. The surface is livid, the solids are shrunk,
the skin of the hands and feet is corrugated. There seems
no sufficient evidence of any uncommon tendency in the body
to putrefaction after death, nor of any characteristic fcetor
from the abdominal cavity. No particular morbid appearances have been found in any of the cavities of the body,
which are lined with serous membranes, or in these membranes themselves. The cavities of the pleura, of the pericardium, and of the peritoneum, have almost uniformly been
found in a natural state, or the deviations from that state
have manifestly had no connexion with cholera. The surfaces
which are lined or covered with mucous membranes, have, on
the contrary, very generally exhibited signs of disease.
These will be noticed, as the organs connected with them
come to be mentioned.
" The lungs have not unfrequently been found in a natural
state, even in cases where much oppression of respiration
had existed previously to death. Much more generally,
however, they have been found either to be gorged with
dark blood, so that they have lost their characteristic appearance, and have assumed more that of liver or spleen;
or they have been found to be in the opposite state-that
is, collapsed into an extremely small bulk, and lying in the,   Op. cit., p. 69.
