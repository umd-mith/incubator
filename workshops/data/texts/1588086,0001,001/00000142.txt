ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


nor scarlet fever is prevented by its being so cured, and the
danger of these diseases is increased by the drugs; if the
looseness be the precursor of either typhus or scarlet fever,
the person is certainly in a worse condition after his dose of
opium than if he had been let alone, and it is very doubtful
whether the cholera be kept away or not by stopping the
diarrhoea in this manner. In these circumstances, is it right

stimulants and narcotics.
Our last objection is on moral grounds. Cholera is a disease

the room sitting round the table drinking spirits. We asked
them if they had no fear of death? and one of the women
replied, that a doctor had been up, and told them there was
nothing like brandy for keeping off cholera.  The poor
