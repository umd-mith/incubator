traversing the wide plains swifter than the fleet Cossacks, who
are their only inhabitants. It convinced those who had most
to do with it, that it was altogether in vain to attempt to arrest
its progress by quarantine measures.*   Seven hundred and
sixty vessels arrived from places where cholera was raging,
at different ports of Britain, and not a case occurred on board
the vessels, or at the quarantine stations outside the Categat Sea.t   It did not go where men were thickest; it went
fastest where there were no men. It therefore did not advance by contagion. We do not say that it is not contagious; on the contrary, we intend to reserve the discussion
of that for the next Chapter; but we say that the hypothesis
of its contagiousness never could be made to account for its
course from India to this country.
The few conditions of its progress that we have become
acquainted with are the following:-It has a decided affinity
for water. By casting a glance at the map which accompanies this volume, this will be recognised at once. It has
a strong tendency to run up rivers, even to their very source.
It frequently declines in winter, to revive with the approach
of summer. It is most fatal in large, low-lying towns. It
passes rapidly over plains; it finds difficulty in getting over
hills. It has hitherto confined itself to certain parallels of
latitude. Its progress is generally most rapid in autumn,
and its course is in a westerly direction.
These are nearly all the unquestionable facts taught us
by its two successive invasions of Europe.
The next question we come to discuss is a most obscure
one. It is this. Since contagion fails to account for the
progress of cholera all round the world, by what force is it
