ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.

of cholera must fail altogether to give a just idea of the appearance presented by the disease; for even supposing that
the terms used by the describer were so appropriate as to
convey to the mind of another the exact notion which was
in his own, yet there would still be this immense difference
between them, that the reader would only acquire gradually
the impression of the various phenomena which the beholder
receives instantaneously.  Although this remark applies
more or less to all descriptions of disease as contradistinguished from their actual observation, yet it is peculiarly
applicable to the one we have now to do with, for in it there
is a combination of an unusual number of symptoms. It is
unlike all diseases we have ever beheld in this respect-that
it fills the mind with a sense of horror. Many other maladies
are far more painful, more deadly, some as rapid, many more
loathsome; but none are so full of horror. And this sensation is quite irrespective of our knowledge of the probable
termination of the attack. The reason of this seems to us to
be this:-Disease in all its other forms attacks the person;
we can distinguish the two, so to speak-we see the combat
