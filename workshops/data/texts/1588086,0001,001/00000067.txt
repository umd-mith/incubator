disturbed state of its electricity. This was clearly demonstrated by the fact, that the electric machines could not be
charged, and to a great extent lost their power, as generally
happens whenever the atmosphere is damp and unsettled.
The same remark was made respecting the strength of several
large magnets; and it has been reported since I left St.
Petersburg, that the weather having become more settled,
the electric machines and magnets have recovered their
power. This disturbed condition of the electricity of the air
was also indicated by the peculiarly depressed and uneasy
state of feeling which almost everybody complained of more
or less; some entirely losing their sleep, whilst others slept
more heavily than usual. Few persons, in fact, during that
period, escaped suffering from some degree of derangement
in their health."
Dr. Crawford's last observation in regard to the electric
phenomena is very interesting, for to this point we naturally turn for some light upon the mysterious influences
which pervade the atmosphere during the prevalence of any
deadly distemper. We find that thunderstorms have frequently been observed to attend epidemics; we know that
our frames are powerfully affected by the electric condition
of the air; and further, while the positive electricity decreases from sunset, and reaches its lowest point between
sunset and sunrise, it has been observed that persons are
generally seized with cholera in the night-time.*
The intimate relation of electricity to magnetism in all its
branches, naturally leads us to the researches of Reichenbach; and certainly it is a very curious fact, that sensitive
persons, and they alone, should be affected by the current
which is always in the line of the magnetic meridian. We
