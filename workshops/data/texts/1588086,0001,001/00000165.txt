ITS PATHOLOGY-EXCITING CAUSES.

month of June, when the disease appeared, is the period of
one of their long religious fasts of three weeks' duration.
The people abstain all this time from the use of animal food
of every kind, including milk, eggs, and butter. The diet
consists chiefly, besides fish and rye-bread, of vegetables,
such as cabbage, cucumbers, and other varieties of the

very lowering for labouring people, is of a nature to create a
tendency to bowel complaints. Although the Archbishop
allowed the people to dispense with the fast, and the Emperor ordered meat for the soldiers, such was the strong attachment of the lower classes to their accustomed rites, that
they generally continued the observance of the fast, and it
was sometimes found difficult to persuade them to take even
a little broth, although the saving of their lives seemed to
depend on their being sustained by suitable nourishment."*
The following quotation from Mr. Scot's work brings into
view how improper aliment and physic excite the disease:"Many instances are noticed where cholera has supervened on the use of neutral purgative salts. The effect of
these medicines bears, indeed, a strong resemblance to some
of the appearances in cholera. The clear, watery, debilitating stools; the chill, and, in feverish subjects, the ague
fits which they cause, obviously point them out as unsafe,
especially during the prevalence of this disease. Cases of
cholera terminating in death have occurred after drinking
unwholesome liquors. An instance of this happened in a
party of six men, who, after drinking together, were all
