ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


symptoms of cholera. Professor J6rg of Leipzig undertook
a series of experiments to disprove Homceopathy.* The following are the effects he describes as resulting from camphor.
We translate them from the condensed notice by Wibmer.tJdrg, after taking half a grain of camphor, felt a sense of
heat in the stomach; during the night, severe pain in the
region of the solar plexus (bauch-ganglion.)  The next day
he had a dull headach; a whole grain caused heat of
stomach; after two hours' perspiration, a quick pulse;
thirst; rush of blood to the head.  In the afternoon, shaking of the hands for half an hour. In the evening, pressive
pain about the solar plexus. A grain and a half caused
warmth; perspiration. In the evening, again severe pressive pain in the solar plexus, which extended upwards to the
lungs and caused cough.     The pulse was accelerated ten
beats, and the night was uncomfortable. In the morning,
there was a dull sensation in the abdominal region, and torpidity of the colon. Two grains caused warmth, perspiration, eructation, griping, enuresis, inclination to stool. In
the evening, again pain in the plexus, slight thirst, and a
restless night.
The observations of Jorg are fully confirmed by various
experimenters. Among the morbid phenomena observed
in the bodies of animals poisoned by camphor, is one of
especial interest to us, which is, that the heart was no longer
contractile, although examined immediately after death.+
The operation of camphor seems even to throw light upon the
pathology of cholera. It seems to act through the medium
of the pneumogastric nerves upon the solar plexus, the
