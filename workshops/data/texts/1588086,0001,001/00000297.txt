day night. On the following day we were sent for in the
afternoon to see our first case. The poor woman was far
gone when we arrived, and the persons about her told us
that they did not know where to go for assistance, until a
neighbour, who had read one of our hand-bills, informed
them of our being ready to attend at all hours, and then they
came for us. Had it not been for us she would have died
without medical attendance altogether-like a dog-unless,
indeed, the appearance of the medical officer attached to the
Police Office, within two hours of her death, could be called
medical attendance. He came to certify the case-to be sure
that it was really cholera, that he might report it to the Town
Council; and we suppose he did his duty. On the following morning we were rather surprised to find all our handbills torn down, and to be told it was done by order of the
Lord Provost, and that the man employed by us to put them
up had been taken into custody. The Secretary was immediately requested to communicate with his Lordship, and
ascertain whether such was the fact, and if so, what was the
reason of a proceeding which seemed to us most strange.
His Lordship* admitted the fact, and gave as his reason,
that it was the opinion of himself and some other gentlemen,
who had tried to form a Board of Health, that our hand-bills
were calculated to frighten people, and therefore were not
to be allowed. On being expostulated with as to the unreasonableness and cruelty of such a step, and that it exceeded the powers of the Police, he replied, " That the Police
were omnipotent." It is a pity he had not given them orders
to arrest the cholera in that case. Of course we had nothing
for it but to acquiesce in his absolute wisdom-although it
did seem rather strange that his Lordship should show so
much tenderness for the fears of the poor as to prefer allow* The predecessor of the present Provost.
