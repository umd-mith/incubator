ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


&amp;c. The mortality was so great, in fine, that between break
of day and dinner-time there were swept away by this pestilence seventy thousand persons.*
It is said to have ravaged Europe in 1600; and Ozanam
gives the following quotation from Zacutus de Lisbonne," Anno 1600, quando hsec pestifera lues Europam fere
totam oppresserat, observavi plures qui hoc diro dolore affecti venenosis symptomatibus excruciati, occubugre omnes;
nullus quartum diem pertransit.  *        *        *
" Materia semicruda cum ichoribus multis ubertim qui
per alvum et vomitum protrudit et multoties in tanta copia
ut ob exhaustum spiritum superveniant syncope, animi deliquia, virium jactura, pulsus ablati, intensissima sitis, convulsio, rigor, nervorum retractiones, aphonia, stupor, caligo
oculorum, extremorum    frigiditas, anxietas, angor, facies
hippocratica et mors." (De Prax. Admirand. lib. ii. obs. 23
and xv.)
But at best these are but dim notices-more interesting
to the antiquarian than to the practitioner; and we pass to
clearer descriptions by writers of the present day.
In casting one's eye upon the map of India, it is impossible
not to be struck with the watering of the great plain of the
Ganges. Not only does the main trunk ramify on both
sides as we track it upward towards its source, but instead of
dlebouching by one large outlet, like rivers confined by barriers as in our own country, it splits into many fingers, as it
were-each of which finds its own separate entrance into
the sea. There are few plains in the world watered like the
Delta of the Ganges. Here it was that in the summer and
autumn of 1817, cholera burst out in various places simultaneously, destroying six thousand of the inhabitants of the
town of Jessore, about eighty miles north-east from Cal* The works of Flavius Josephus, by Sir Thomas l'Estrange. London, 1702.
