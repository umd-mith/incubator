those lately observed from the incautious inhalation of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas. Gehlen the chemist died of this
accident; but no particular account has been published of
the symptoms he suffered. Two cases, however, have been
minutely detailed within a few years. In one of these, which
has been related by Dr. Schlinder of Greifensberg, the individual inhaled in forty minutes about half a cubic inch of

arsenic. In three hours he became affected with giddiness;
