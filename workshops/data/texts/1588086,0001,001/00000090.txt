harbour, however, he found himself so unwell as not to be
able to return on board, and died of cholera next morning
in the Leith Hospital at twelve o'clock. This was the second
case of the disease observed in Leith, the first having occurred about a month previously in a man who had been
visiting his infected relations at Musselburgh.-3. The other
sailor who landed with him was also obliged to remain on
shore, and had an attack of cholera that night, but recovered.

smack was seized with vomiting and purging immediately
after the preventive boat visited the smack in the roads;and the vessel having been ordered ten miles up the river to
the quarantine station at St. Margaret's Hope, he was, when
the vessel arrived there about five o'clock of the same evening, transferred to the hospital-ship Nymphe. The Nymphe
(one of the old men-of-war employed as quarantine vessels
in the station) had been previously cleared out as an hospitalship to receive a suspicious case of cholera which had occurred on board one of the vessels under quarantine on the
2d Maroh, but this man had been discharged as well on the
5th. At the time that the sailor from the Trusty was placed
in the Nymphe, on the evening of the 9th March, the
Nymphe had only two mariners left on board, who had
volunteered to act as nurses.  On the 11th, two other
mariners were joined to these; and on the 16th, a fifth was
added. The sailor from the Trusty had a severe attack, but
continued in life till the 16th.-5. In the afternoon of the
10th, a second sailor was transferred from the Trusty to the
Nymphe, labouring under cholera. He recovered.- 6, 7. On
the 11th, two new men were attacked, and sent to the
Nymphe, both of whom died. One of them was a Leith
porter, who had come on board the vessel in Leith roads,
having returned with the boats which landed tlhe passengers.
