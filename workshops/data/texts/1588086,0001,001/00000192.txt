ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


Fever.-Chilliness, shivering, trembling, and chattering of
the teeth. Pulse rapid, soft, and full, intermittent.
Moral symptoms.-Great anxiety and depression of spirits.
Head.-Pain in the head; vertigo.
Eyes.-Dark circle round the eyes; eyes dull.
Ears.-Noise in the ears.
Face.-Pale and anxious; sometimes cold; expression
uneasy and peculiar.
So remarkable is this change of expression, that in India
servants can scarcely be recognised by their masters, even in
the early stage of the disease. Mr. Annesly, who is a great
authority on the subject, says: â€”" A practitioner, possessed
of true professional tact, will discover in the countenance of
the patient the earliest changes which mark the approaching
invasion of the disease." *
Mouth.-Tongue white, loaded, covered with a yellow fur.
Appetite.-Great thirst; nausea.
Stomach.-Nausea and vomiting; pain at epigastrium.
Abdomen.-Pain in abdomen; soreness; tenderness on
pressure; pain below umbilicus; griping of the bowels.
Fceces.-Heat in ano; suppression of stools; constant ineffectual desire to pass stools; loose stools of a natural colour,
or dark brown, or greyish.
Urine.-Ineffectual desire to urinate; urine pale.
Chest.-Oppression of chest.
These are the chief symptoms met with in the first stage,
or the invasion of cholera; but of course they are not all
present in every case, some are much more constant than
others. We should feel inclined to consider the following
group to be pathognomonic: Sudden sense of illness, giddiness, nausea, perhaps vomiting, a great change in the ex* Reports on the Epidemic Cholera, published by the Medical Board of Bombay-Preface.
