ON EPIDEMICS IN GENERAL.

in Egypt are flies. Men and animals are grievously tormented
by them. It is impossible to form an adequate conception
of their fury when they wish to fix themselves on any part
of the body. If they are driven away, they light again the
same instant, and their pertinacity wearies the most patient."
We class these first four plagues together, because they
are of a local character-being peculiar to the climate and
geographical conditions of Egypt. However, we may notice
in passing, that a great increase of insect life has frequently
been observed to attend or precede many epidemics, and,
among others, the cholera. So that perhaps we may legitimatelv include the inundation of frogs, gnats, and flies in
the proper series of antecedents of the subsequent great
mortality, although the nature of the soil of Egypt gave it
what we may call a predisposition to suffer from them to an
unusual degree, and that they should be of an unusual kind.
The fifth plague was the destruction of cattle by a murrain. Before an epidemic, it is not uncommon to have a
disease among the lower animals. A most deadly distemper
prevailed among the cattle in this country during the years
1-846-47. Whether we have a right to regard the potato
disease as the first indication of the approach of an epidemic,
is certainly a curious question-as if beneath the first wave
of noxious influence, there drooped the most sensitive of
the vegetable kingdom, under the second there fell the
cattle, and under the third man-the disease in each case
being conditioned by its subject.
The sixth plague-that of boils-was probably some painful but not deadly cutaneous eruption. We have an example of a mild epidemic preceding a deadly one in the influenza of 1847. A succession of epidemics increasing in
severity has also been noticed.  Thus in the years 1733,
1 738, and 1 743, there raged a succession of epidemics quite
