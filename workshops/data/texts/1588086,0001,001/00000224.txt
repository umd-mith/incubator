and those early treated. Yet there are examples of even
severe cases having been dismissed cured in three or four
days.  In general, the recovery took from  ten to sixteen
days to complete."
The following table shows the mortality in the cases
treated by us, and the average duration of the cases, including typhoid ones:
Average time.

These cases occurred between the 4th October and the
1st of February. During the same period in Edinburgh,
among patients of precisely the same class, and in exactly
similar situation and circumstances, there occurred under
Allopathic treatmentCases.    Recoveries.  Deaths.
876        271         546
which gives a mortality of 62 per cent. That is, if a
thousand persons had been attacked, 620 would have died
under the ordinary treatment, and only 380 recovered!  A
frightful mortality!  While, if a thousand had been treated
according to the Homceopathic system, 240 would have died,
and 760 would have recovered. Still a great mortality.
In making our calculations, we have used the tables furnished to us by the Secretary of the Board of Health, and
in the next Chapter they will be found at full length.
We think we may now consider the hypothetical position
we started with as established beyond a doubt, that in
various countries, in this epidemic the result has uniformly
been more favourable under Homceopathic than under Allopathic treatment, and we shall therefore pass at once to a consideration of the measures employed by Homoeopathic practi
