Stool.-Constipation; diarrhoea; copious, painful, blackish evacuations, sometimes mixed with blood, attended with
tenesmus and weakness.
Urine.-Scanty urine.
Chest.-Difficulty in breathing, and spasmodic contraction
of the chest; suffocative arrest of breathing; oppression of
the heart; anxiety about the heart.
Limbs.-Trembling of the limbs; spasmodic painful contraction of the fingers and toes; painful jerking in the hands
and feet, extending into the upper arms, and passing into a
cramp of the calves when it reached the legs; coldness of the
limbs; cool hands; pains in the thighs; violent cramps in
the calves, during which the two big toes are tetanically drawn
towards the soles of the feet with great pain.
Secale cornutum, or ergot of rye, is a medicine in which
we have great faith in some of the worst varieties of cholera.
We have seen the most decided advantage from its administration in cases of very copious discharges both alvine and
by vomiting. While we would recommend cuprum and
veratrum to be given rather by themselves than in alternation, we should feel inclined to give secale alternately with
arsenicum. It is not easy to give a reason for this beyond
the observation, that so given, we have seen more benefit to
the patient than from either singly; and we do not think
that the two medicines interfere. We should give it strong,
in the first, second, or third dilution; a dose every half-hour
alternately with arsenic; and this in cases, particularly of
women, where there is great prostration and violent watery
discharges. We have seen cases, which we looked upon as
quite hopeless, steadily rally under this treatment; and we
have no doubt of the beneficial effects of the remedies.
By far the fullest account of the effects of ergot of rye is
