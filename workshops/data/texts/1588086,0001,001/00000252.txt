Copper, both in the form of cuprum metallicum and cuprum aceticum, is a very valuable remedy in cholera.  The
cases for which it answers best are those attended with violent
spasms, and with or without copious discharges; it does not
seem of much use when there is great collapse. We prefer the
acetate of copper to the metallic copper, rather from a general
belief in the greater certainty and rapidity of the action of
soluble salts, than from any comparative experience of the efficacy of the two. If the metallic copper be given, it should be
given in dry powder, and if the acetate be used, it may be given
either in solution or in powder, as circumstances indicate. We
have seen very marked mitigation of the cramps after its administration, and we have great confidence in recommending
its frequent repetition when these are severe. A dose may be
given every five or ten minutes. We have generally employed the third dilution of the acetate, and have no reason to
suppose that any other dilution would have answered better.
