" As she had long been affected with a gradually increasing
illness, the author inquired if at any former period this sensibility to position had occurred; and it appeared that she
had lived in different houses, and had suffered uneasiness in
some, while in others she had felt comfortable, without the
cause being known. Her brother was now told to take a
compass and ascertain the position of her beds in the different houses, as well as of her couches and work-chairs. It
was found that in one house her bed and couch had accidentally been almost exactly in the magnetic meridian, and
that she had lain with her head towards north, not towards
south. In another house she had lain in a line north-east
and south-west. In fact, she had been comfortable in the
former, while in the latter she had always suffered and
struggled with illness. Even now, without knowing why,
she could not bear to sit across her bed or sofa, neither
could she lie on the sofa, but could only bear to lie in bed.
In the first case her position was from west to east, in the
second east to west, in the third south to north; only in
the last could she obtain the indispensable position from
north to south.
" Of all positions, the worst by far was that from west to
east, that is, the head to the west.
" 64. Mdlle. Sturmann, in consequence of violent dancing,
3 years before, was attacked by her illness. She now suffered from tubercles in the lungs, and was subject to cataleptic attacks. The author found her lying in the position
from west to east.   In this position, the great magnet
(carrying eighty lb.) placed above her head or under her feet,
had hardly any effect. She was then placed in the position
from north to south. The change was instantaneous. The
patient at once expressed a feeling of comfort, the previously
existing restlessness ceased; a painful sensation of heat in
the eyes, which had constantly annoyed her, disappeared,
