the cure of cholera. The following case is recorded in
the works ascribed to Hippocrates:-" A young Athenian
affected with cholera evacuated upwards and downwards with
much suffering, nothing could arrest the vomiting or alvine
evacuations. His voice failed, he could not stir from bed.
His eyes were lustreless and sunken. He had convulsions
of the lower extremities from the abdomen downwards. He
had hiccough, and the stools were more copious than the vomitings.  He took veratrum in lentil juice,"* and recovered.
Hippocrates was an unconscious homceopathist. Had he
lived after Hahnemann, he would have gloried in a profession of its principles, and utterly disavowed those who now
call themselves by his name. Just as Abraham would have
been a Christian had he lived after the introduction of
Christianity, and disowned as not his real children those who
now bear his name, and prefer the exaltation of a race to the
salvation of a world.
Veratrum was the medicine in highest repute during the
former epidemic. Fleischmann gives it usually alternately
with arsenicum. And in the prevalence of Cholera in Petersburgh, Miller mentions that it was the favourite remedy in
the Homoeopathic Hospital there. IIe says that it was given in
tincture; but we rather suspect his accuracy on this point, for the
reason he alleges for its administration is its supposed action
upon the solar plexus of nerves. Such a hypothetical reason
for the selection of medicine could have no place in the mind
of a disciple of Hahnemann. We imagine that observing its
utility he explained it in this way, and supposed that it was
by this road we were led to it. However, nothing can be
clearer than the Homoeopathicity of veratrum for cholera,
in general; we doubt whether it be so perfectly suited to the
present epidemic cholera as arsenicum; at least as far as our
