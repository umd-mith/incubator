tending to dry it up, much less to set it on fire. The combustion of our haystack means that there has been a rapid
union of the oxygen of the air with the carbon and hydrogen of the turpentine and hay. This chemical action, not
cognizable by the senses, gives rise to the phenomenon of a
brilliant light, attended with intense heat, which can be
both seen and felt, and which, were we to carry out our
illustration, would represent the disease as contradistinguished from its proximate cause.
To return from this digression to the consideration of the
predisposing causes of cholera, the first that meets our eye
is sex.  According to the subjoined table, which corresponds in its results to the observations made at the Cholera
Hospital in Edinburgh, the number of females attacked by
the disease was nearly double the number of males. However, let us observe that this table also shows that the great
majority of both the sexes were grown up, and the difference
in the liability of the men and women to the disease may depend upon a difference in the habits, rather than be attributable to the sex alone. We are inclined to this opinion, for we
find the relation of the sexes in reference to cholera to be
reversed in other parts of the world, and it is hardly likely
that climate could effect such a change if it were dependent upon sex alone. For woman's character, although still
"varium et mutabile semper," seems to be essentially the most
unchangeable thing in nature.
In India it appears that a larger proportion of women
than of men were attacked by this disease.  The proportion
of males to females in the suburbs of Calcutta was, according to Mr. Jameson, as four to one; in some other places as
two to one; and this observation is confirmed by Dr. Marshall in Ceylon, and Dr. Scott at Madras.*  At Moscow,
