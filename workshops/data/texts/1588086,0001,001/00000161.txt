ITS PATHOLOGY-EXCITING CAUSES.

it can only be in an indirect, and, to us, an unknown manner; and its continuance, after having once originated epidemically, appears to be unconnected, in the main, with any
sensible state of the weather."
We may make the same observation in regard to the electrical state of the atmosphere as to its other conditions; there
is a general impression in the minds of most persons who
have had much opportunity of observing the cholera, that a
very considerable disturbance of atmospheric electricity, almost constantly, has been a frequent concurrent phenomenon.
We have already referred to various writers who mention
this as their opinion, in very different situations, as for example Petersburgh and Sunderland, and we shall quote one
curious passage from Dr. Orton's work which we have already
so largely laid under contribution. Before doing so we may
observe that Dr. Orton tries to establish the position that
the cholera is caused by a deficiency of electricity, and he has
adduced many instances of all the various phenomena attendant upon such a condition, and shown, or tried to shlow,
that the same phenomena are met with when cholera
breaks out. His chapter is extremely interesting, and we
only regret that want of space prevents our doing fuller
justice to his ingenious investigations. We trust that if the
cholera appear in this country, the most accurate meteorological observations may be kept in every place where it
occurs. The following quotation is given rather with a view
to interest our readers on the subject than to prove any particular point.
"Dr. Heyne, in his 'Tracts on India,' observes,-'These
commotions of the earth are never very violent, and by no
means frequent in this country, occurring about once in five
years. I felt one at Toomkoor (in Mysore) on the 23d October 1800. It is remarkable that at the same time a violent
