RUTLAND SQUARE, June 1849.
MY DEAR DRYSDALE,
To you, as to an elder brother, I dedicate (without
permission) this first publication of mine which has appeared
without your name as well as my own on the title-page. Accept
it as a tribute of affectionate respect for your character, and as the
token of a friendship (esto perpetta) which has now lasted without
interruption for the best part of twenty years.
Yours truly,
J. RUTHERFURD RUSSELL.
J. J. DRYSDALE, ESQ., M.D., Liverpool.
