ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


Trebizond; second, The report of the physicians appointed
by the Swedish government to investigate the disease at
Moscow; third, and last, The opinion of Indian practitioners.
Admitting the evidence derived from these places to be unexceptionable, what is the only conclusion which it justifies? Neither more nor less than this, that the cholera was
not contagious in Turkey, Russia, and India. And the
Commissioners have no right whatever to make the abstract
assertion, that the cholera is not propagated by contagion.
But it may be asked, How could these Commissioners get
at any other evidence? They could not bring the cholera
here, and experiment on the effect of another latitude and
another climate. We reply, that had already been done for
them. If the cholera was quite unchanged in all its features
when it reappeared in Russia and Turkey, is there any
reason to suppose it will be changed when it appears here?
Unless the Commission had the clearest proof that there
had been such a change in the climate and constitution of
this country since 1832, as would necessarily modify the
character of an epidemic like the cholera, and strip it of its
contagious qualities, it was their bounden duty to investigate the evidence for and against the contagiousness of the
disease in its former visitation. This were far more germane to the matter than telling us it was not contagious in
India. It is not so long since the cholera was here as that
all who had to do with it then are now dead and not to be
had as witnesses, and even were it so, there is ample contemporary testimony on which a sound judgment may be
founded.
We propose now leading evidence to prove, that both in
the former and recent epidemic, the cholera was contagious
in Scotland. The Commissioners are not to blame for being
ignorant of the contagion of the recent epidemic, but we
