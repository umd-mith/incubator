ITS PATHOLOGY-EXCITING CAUSES.

been left lying as if she were already dead. She had got
no medicine, and no attendance, and she died within an

capable of being reproduced, in some instances at least, by
the organized beings which are affected by it, and the manifestation of its baneful effects is accompanied generally by
an unusual degree of humidity, either atmospheric or local;
