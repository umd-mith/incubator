and all Biblical students are aware that in his name they
have the best security both for the learning and soundness
of the interpretation of Scripture.
To have a clear idea of the occurrences described in the
beginning of Exodus, we require to determine the relative
locality of the Israelites and Egyptians, and also the time of
year of the events. The land of Goshen seems to have been
the region east of the Tanitic arm of the Nile, as far as the
Isthmus of Suez, on the border of the Arabian desert. It
was therefore a border country, out-lying, not surrounded by
other Egyptian territory. The ten plagues must have occurred between the month of July and the following month of
April.
The absence of contemporary history prevents our knowing whether they were confined to Egypt, or extended over
a larger portion of the earth. It is probable that some remarkable meteorological phenomena had occurred at the
source of the Nile, or, at all events, high up the river. But
whether these supposed phenomena were attended by a pestilence or not, we have no means of ascertaining.
The first four plagues seem all to have arisen from a common cause-an extraordinary inundation of the Nile. The
expression that the waters were turned into blood means
that they looked like blood, and were unfit for use: as
when Joel says-" the sun shall be turned into darkness,
and the moon into blood,"-that is, shall have the colour and

excellent for drinking; but in seasons of great heat, when
the river has been unusually low, on its first rising it is quite
discoloured, and undrinkable. Thus, " in the year 1199 the
increase of the Nile was smaller than it had ever been
known. About two months before the first indications of
the inundation, the waters of the river assumed a green
