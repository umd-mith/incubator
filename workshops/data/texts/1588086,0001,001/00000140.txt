ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


- Surely the bitter self-accusations of some of the most
gifted men that have adorned and instructed our country,
might have acted as a warning against sowing broadcast
over the land so deadly, and yet so insidious a poison. We
repeat, if the alternative were put, as one was to David,
whether we should prefer a brief and fatal epidemic of cholera, or the risk of a great increase of an endemic habit of
intoxication by ardent spirits and opium, the former would
be the kinder and wiser of the two to choose.
We have put the case on the best footing for the Commission; but we must bring it down a long way, for we are
satisfied that opium and brandy do not cure diarrhoea; and
if they did cure it, they would often leave the patient in a
worse condition for what was to follow than if he had been
jet alone.
We have had numerous examples of cases such as this.
When the cholera prevails in a place, diarrhoea also prevails.
A nervous person gets an attack of looseness of his bowels;
he sends for his doctor, who gives him a tea-spoonful of laudanum to make sure against cholera; the diarrhcea stops, but
the bowels are bound, and some headach comes on; again
the doctor is sent for, and he gives a purgative, the headach
goes off, and the looseness returns; in a greater alarm than
ever, his medical adviser is recalled; again he gives a good
large dose of opium in some form, with the same effect as
before, only, that now giddiness and sleeplessness are superadded to constipation. What is to be done next? Another
purgative? that will endanger the return of the diarrhebaleave him alone? that will bring on a state of constipation
almost as dangerous as the diarrhea. We do not know what
better the patient can do than immediately leave the place,
and get out of the hands of his most dangerous medical
friends; if not, he may have to go on taking opium and
