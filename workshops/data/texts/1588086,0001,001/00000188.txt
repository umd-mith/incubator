epithelium.  In other cases, but always associated with
separation of the epithelium, appeared regular ileitis,,the
contents of the intestine being bloody; when the progress
was slower, the first stage of the typhoid process was frequently observable in the neighbourhood of Peyer's glands,
and in the entire lower part of the ilium, with the peculiar
punctiform-arrangement of the typhous formation, without
arriving at actual ulceration. But in other cases there was
ulceration and detachment of the mucous membrane in large
spots, then discoloration and destruction of the mucous
membrane and ecchymosed spots of greater or less extent.
In cases where there was hypostatic pneumonia, the villi
had disappeared at distant intervals, and the intestine appeared quite smooth in some places, while in others it might
be perceived to be rough.
Large intestine.-At the commencement anmemia, the
mucous and muscular tissues unusually folded, (whereby the
volume is diminished,) and covered with a sloughy grey
paste, which consisted of mucus and abraded epithelium.
When the progress is slow, there is considerable hyperaemia,
with a variable number of spots of ecchymosis occupying
either part, or the whole of the intestine. The intestine in
that part looked smooth and red, as if blood had been
smeared on the surface of the mucous membrane.     The
patches of abraded epithelium, which are here of greater
extent than in the small intestine, cannot be removed by the
pouring on of water, and usually disclose, on being peeled
off, an ecchymosed state of the mucous membrane. In several rare cases, there was observed, particularly in the sigmoid flexure and rectum, isolated patches of grey exudation, which in some places exhibited black spots, or large
expanded scablike patches; on being examined with the
microscope, however, although much altered in character,
