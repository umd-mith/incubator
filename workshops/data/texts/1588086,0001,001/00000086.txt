ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


and fifty persons daily, they still were inclined to doubt the
intelligence, and to indulge ill-grounded hope: neglecting
those precautions which, however salutary, must in some
measure bring all commercial affairs to a stop.
" Towards the end of January, the plague advanced so
dreadfully at Nicosia, that the Mohammedans enjoined public processions and supplications: an expedient which, by
bringing together a promiscuous crowd of people, served
only to propagate the contagion more effectually. The Europeans at Larnaka now caught the alarm; for the fugitives
from Nicosia, exaggerating the scenes of calamity from
which they had fled, spread terror wherever they came.
" In the beginning of February, the distemper appeared
among the Turks at the Marine, and soon after, at Larnaka. The Europeans shut up. The daily burials soon increased to eight or ten; and during February, never exceeded twenty. In the month of March, the disease would
appear to have been more malignant than at first, for few
or none of the infected recovered. The daily funerals arose
to twenty-five and thirty; and many of the inhabitants fled
to the mountains.
" The distemper continued to rage at Larnaka all the
month of April; and spread, at the same time, over the
island-penetrating even into the province of Carpass, a circumstance not known to have ever happened before. At
the Marine, the daily burials decreased, which was attributed to the flight of the wretched inhabitants; many of
whom, like those of Larnaka, abandoned their half-desolate
houses, and sought refuge in the country."
It committed such devastation over this country, that there
were hardly hands enough left to gather in the harvest:
giving a sad significance to the cypress-tree, which derives
its name from the island.
