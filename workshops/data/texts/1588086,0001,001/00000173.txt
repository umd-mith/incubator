ITS PATHOLOGY-PROXIMATE CAUSE.

pression is thrown upon the solar plexus and the par vagum,
which are closely connected together, and produces the partial death of those nerves, called with much justice abdominal
paralysis or apoplexy."*
Examples of a similar kind will be found in Sir C. Bell's
work upon the nerves.
Many poisons operate so swiftly as to make it almost certain that they act through the nerves. Magendie, speaking
of the effects of pure hydrocyanic, compares it in point of
swiftness to a thunderbolt. Dr. Christison was unable to
detect an appreciable interval between the moment when
conia, the active principle of hemlock, was inserted into the
leg of a dog, and that in which the animal died.t  The poison of some kinds of serpents is also very rapid. Russell, in
his treatise upon Indian serpents, mentions the case of a
servant girl who was bit by a species of boa, and died in
ten minutes after the wound was inflicted.+   The resemblance between the effects produced by bites of poisonous
snakes and cholera is so striking, that Mr. Coates, in his
Report to the Medical Board of Bombay, says, " I should
have pronounced that some of my patients (with cholera)
had been labouring under snake-bites, had I not been better
informed." ~
The remarkable general resemblance between cholera and
the plague must strike every one who attentively considers
the phenomena of both. The following are the heads given
in Russell's History of the Plague of the various symptoms:
Fever, delirium, coma, impediment or loss of speech, deafness, muddiness of the eyes, white tongue, state of the pulse,
