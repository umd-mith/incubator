ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


num, he reverts to his water-drinking till the next receipt
of pay, or till he has hoarded up the means of renewing the
excessive stimulus. The prospect of sickness, or even death,
have no terrors for him to keep in check this inordinate appetite. And to this circumstance we must chiefly refer the
greater prevalence of cholera in the European soldier than
the officer. Thle former is sufficiently clothed and fed, and
his frame is generally somewhat robust; there is, therefore,
no predisponent debility to account for it. Other circumstances also, doubtless, contribute to produce the superior general
healthiness of the officer, as his greater general care of his
health and attention to its first derangements; and particularly the greater influence of mind, and the amusement which
it creates; for ennui and inactivity of mind, as well as of
body, are a great cause of disease, and nowhere so remarkably as in hot climates.
" The greater prevalence of the disease among the sepoys
than their European officers, which is as remarkable as in
the other case, is to be placed to another account. They are
perfectly temperate, as are almost all the natives of India,
but this temperance is with many of them perforce carried to
excess. It is evident that the greater liability to this epidemic of the sepoy than his officer, and indeed of the natives
in general, compared with the Europeans in India, is owing
to a diet not sufficiently nutritious to ward off the attacks of
a disease which is so eminently one of debility, although it is
undoubtedly better calculated than ours to obviate the commoner form of Indian disease, pure inflammation. The pay
of the sepoy is about fivepence per day, and on this most of
them have families as well as themselves to maintain. Yet
this is affluence compared with the situation of most of the
inferior servants, grooms, tent-men, porters, &amp;c., who receive
not more than from half to two-thirds of that sum; and they
