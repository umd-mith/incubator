and very learned physician of Edinburgh, still living at an
advanced age, very happily illustrates this point. On some
one boasting before him of the marvellous cures wrought by
the small doses of the 1Homceopathists, he said, 'this was no
peculiar cause for boasting, as he himself had, for the last
two years, been curing his patients with even less, viz., with
nothing at all!'"
The effect of this doctrine upon the profession must be
most disastrous. Without a strong faith there can be no
strong action. But not only can there be no hearty trust

are fast corrupting our whole social frame? It may seem
absurd to find any connexion between Red Republicanism and
Young Physic. But we believe that the flag of terror which
is now waving over all Europe is the necessary result of a
system of deceit, and that every one who advocates or prac
