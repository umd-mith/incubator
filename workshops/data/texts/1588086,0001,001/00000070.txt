ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


allow her bed to be placed as she desired it to be. She was
requested, as an experiment, to lie down with her head to
the south. It took several days to persuade her to do so,
and she only consented in consideration of the weight which
the author attached to the experiment. At last, one morning he found her in the desired position, which she had assumed very shortly before. She very soon began to complain of discomfort, she became restless, flushed, her pulse
became more frequent and fuller, a rush of blood to the head
increased the headach, and the sensation of nausea soon
attacked the stomach. The bed with the patient was now
turned, but was stopped half-way, when she lay in a magnetic parallel, with the head to the west. This position was
far more disagreeable than the former; indeed, absolutely
intolerable. This was at half-past eleven, A.M. She felt as
if she would soon faint, and begged to be removed out of
this position. This was done, and as soon as she was restored to the original position, with the head to the north,
all disagreeable sensations diminished, and in a few minutes
were so completely gone, that she was again cheerful. But
besides these very disagreeable feelings which acted profoundly on her, in the altered position, all her sensations, in
regard to external matters, were altered. For example, the
streaking with a magnet, usually so agreeable, was now disagreeable; and if strong, intolerable; and, in short, all her
relations to different substances took a new and very different form.
" All these experiments were at different times repeated,
and with exactly the same results. She could hardly endure
the position from west to east, or that from east to west, more
than a minute, without feeling all the symptoms above described, with a tendency to syncope, and recovered instantly
when the position was changed to that of north to south.
