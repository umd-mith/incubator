fore the first is finished at another no great distance off; and
in the narrative of the occurrences two or more may have been
blended, and thus at the outset create inextricable confusion.
The only instance in ancient and strictly authentic history where we have a series of such occurrences may be
considered by many as altogether out of the pale of scientific
investigation, belonging to the preternatural, not to the
natural order of events. We refer to the Plagues of Egypt,
described by Moses. To prevent misunderstanding, we are
anxious to begin by saying, that supposing the phenomena
in question to be strictly in accordance with natural laws,
this does not at all imply that they are not also miraculous.
The meaning of a miracle is not to introduce a new power

effect this object it is not necessary that any known laws
of nature be suspended, far less violated; it is enough that
the events be such as cannot at the time be referred to any
known sequences, on account of their nature, their intensity,
or their concentration, as it were, into one point, and that
point indicating a great moral purpose.* The miracle will be

all the world; they are a vast revelation of Him. " The invisible things of
Him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His
