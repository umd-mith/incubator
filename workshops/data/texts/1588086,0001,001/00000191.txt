ITS SYMPTOMS.

beings, is suddenly changed into cold, damp, dead flesh. The
bond of union is converted into an impassable barrier. There
is no more sympathy between it and a living man than if it
were in reality a corpse; and yet the mind is clear, confined
though it be in this cold prison. In one word, we feel as if we
were holding intercourse with a haunted corpse. To those
who never saw a case of cholera, this may seem an absurd
exaggeration; but we do not think that any one who has
come in contact with the disease in its most appalling form.
will accuse us of overstating the feeling of horror which
came over him when he saw the cholera for the first time.
However inadequate any description may be to convey a full
idea of the disease, yet it is essential that we should have as
accurate a register as possible of the various symptoms, that
we may be able to discover the most suitable remedies.
There are four stages of the disease which it is important
to distinguish.  First, the invasion; second, the collapse;
third, the reaction; fourth, the consecutive fever. It may be
a question whether the last should be spoken of as a stage
of cholera, and not rather as a consequence of the disease,
which judicious treatment may in a great measure prevent.
However, for practical purposes, it is no matter whether we
regard it as the last stage of cholera, or as the first stage of
a new disease which cholera alone gives rise to.
In detailing the symptoms of the various stages, we shall
follow the method we are in the habit of employing in making a register of a case, as it has many conveniences, and is
besides familiar to all homeopathic practitioners.
The general symptoms of the invasion of cholera are rapid
prostration of strength; inability to sit or stand; languor;
vertigo on rising; restlessness; general uneasiness; pains
throughout the whole body; soreness of the body.
The skin is colder than usual, and moist, or dry and cold.
