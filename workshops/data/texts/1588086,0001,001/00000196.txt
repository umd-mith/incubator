when again felt, very small and quick, so that it cannot be
counted.
Moral symptoms.-Great anxiety; inquires anxiously
whether she will recover; afraid of instant death; begs us
not to leave her or she will die; despair of recovery; cries
out, " I am dying: I cannot live."
Head.-Vertigo; headach; noise in the head.
Eyes.-Eyes sunk, open, glassy; eyeballs leaden-coloured;
eyes inflamed. The affection of the eye is peculiar and
characteristic, so that it is sometimes called by the natives
of India the " red-eye sickness."  Mr. Scot* gives the following account of what he himself observed:-" While looking earnestly into the countenance of a patient, I saw the
vessels of the conjunctiva deeply injected with blood in a
moment of time. I was able distinctly to trace its progress:
it was arterial blood, propelled in a jet from the back part
of the globe of the eye, forward to the verge of the cornea,
presenting that appearance sufficiently known in cholera,
and which has led the natives of India to denominate it as
the 'red-eye sickness.'"
Ears.-Noise in the ears; deafness.
Face.-Cold; livid; blue; pale and anxious; sunk and
ghastly; expression uneasy, wild, of terror; dejected; haggard; features contracted and sharpened; cold perspiration
in face; twitching of the muscles of the face.
Mouth.-Dark areola round the mouth; lips cold and
flabby; tongue bluish, cold, flabby, and moist; feels like a
piece of raw meat.
Throat.-Sensation of choking; inability to swallow.
Appetite.-Insatiable thirst. " Intensissima sitis."
In one instance, a poor woman drank all the water out of
a bottle of hot water put at her feet to warm them. The
intense thirst was one of the most painful symptoms.
