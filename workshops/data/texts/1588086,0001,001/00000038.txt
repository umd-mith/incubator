INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.


ink; but he (Dr. Barker) found that after allowing it to
stand for a short period, the black colouring matter separated
from the water with which it had been mixed, rendering the
colour of the rain much lighter than at first. The places in
which this phenomenon occurred were Abbeyleix, Carlow,
Kilkenny, and Athy, from which it would appear that the
black shower had extended over an area of more than 400
square miles. As far as he had been able to ascertain, it
occurred about six o'clock in the evening of the 14th instant,
being preceded by such extreme darkness that it was impossible to read except by candle-light. After this darkness had
existed for some time, a hail-storm, attended with vivid
lightning, but without thunder, occurred, and when this
subsided, the black rain fell. It was mentioned by his Carlow correspondent, that upon examining a quantity of this
rain just after it had fallen, he found it had an extremely
foetid smell, and a very disagreeable taste; that it had left
a stain upon some clothes on which it had fallen, and that
cattle refused to drink it. At Abbeyleix and Athy, where
the shower descended at the same moment, the appearance
of the rain was precisely similar to that which fell in Carlow, but it was unaccompanied by the lightning which had
been observed at the latter place. *Dr. Barker then stated
that as yet he had not been enabled to make a complete
chemical analysis of the rain.'"
With reference to the tenth plague, which interests us most
at present, we may quote the following observations from
Hengstenberg: -"It may be proper to remark here, before we
proceed with the tenth plague, that the phrase 'all the firstborn,' must not be pressed too far. The whole tenor of the
narrative is opposed to such a proceeding, and particularly
the declaration, ' there was no house where there was not
one dead,' since in every house there was not a first-born.
