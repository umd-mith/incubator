ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


empty of chyle. The liver has been commonly found to be
gorged with blood, but not always: it is an organ usually
very vascular; and it would probably demand a nicer dis â€”
crimination than has been bestowed on the subject, to distinguish the degree of congestion in which it is naturally
left by the settling of the blood after death in ordinary diseases, from that which has been observed after an attack of
cholera. The gall bladder has almost universally been found
to contain bile, and, in the great majority of cases, even to
be completely filled with it. As is usual with this secretion
in cases of retention, it is of a dark colour. Very different
states of the gall ducts have been described-cases of constriction and impermeability seeming to be equally numerous
with those of an opposite character.
" The urinary bladder is found, we may say universally,
without urine, and very much contracted. The lining or mucous membranes of the bladder and ureters have been found
coated with a whitish mucous fluid. The appearance of the
spleen, which is so various under the ordinary conditions of
the body after death, has indicated nothing that can be
mentioned as belonging to cholera. The vessels of the mesentery have been very generally found to be uncommonly full
of blood. In the head, appearances of congestion, and even
of extravasation, have been frequently observed, but not so
uniformly, nor to such extent as to require any particular
notice. Only one case has been given, where the state of
the spinal marrow was examined, and in that, indications of
great inflammation were detected in its sheath; the case,
however, was in some degree a mixed one."
