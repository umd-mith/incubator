not be contagious. And what we most dislike, is their
speaking about the demoralizing effects of the doctrine of
contagion. Careful investigation and accurate conclusions
are the morals of science. With the consequences which
may flow from the discovery of truth, scientific inquirers, as
such, have nothing to do.
To return from this digression, we shall proceed at once
to call our witnesses to prove that, in Scotland in 1832, the
cholera was contagious; and in doing so, we shall quote
largely from an article that appeared in No. cxxxv. of the
Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, by Professor Simpson of Edinburgh,* as we look upon it as a model of scientific investigation, worthy of the present renown of its author,
which this and his other early labours show to be no less
well earned than it is now far spread.
" The Leith and London Smack Trusty arrived at London
on the 19th of February, and after remaining in port for

the 8th. This man assisted on the same night another of
the crew and a cabin boy to pull ashore the six passengers,
in the boat belonging to the smack. When he reached the

by infected individuals.
