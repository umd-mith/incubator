ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.

lists I have myself carefully examined, there have died
hitherto three-eighths of the patients, among whom, however,

from Miller's Report, a work impossible to be obtained in

of this paragraph; unfortunately in the present state of
things, people must write to please their readers, (sad degra
