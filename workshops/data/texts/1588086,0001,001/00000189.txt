blood corpuscules were perceived. When this was removed
with the knife, ecchymosed spots were again found.
Next occurred the various grades of diarrhceic and dysenteric ulceration.
Mesenteric Glands.-In all those acute cases where true
cholera discharge existed in the intestinal canal, and the
peculiar solitary villous development and abrasion of the
epithelium, the mesenteric glands presented an enlargement
both characteristic and peculiar. They were swollen and
infiltrated as in typhus, but of a pale yellow colour, like
what is called herring-milt.
The urinary and sexual system exhibited nothing particular.
The Peritoneum had a distinctly greasy feel like the
pleural sack, so that the fingers were actually stuck together
by it.
Cases that had run their course rapidly always exhibited
a very dark-coloured, wrinkled, and withered state of the
skin, and were distinguished by a high degree of muscular
rigidity.
It was observed that in the vast number of bodies examined not a single case of acute tubercular disease, which is
generally so common in Petersburgh, was met with.  This
very important and interesting observation coincides with the
statement of Professor Roketansky of Vienna, who noticed
a similar immunity from cholera on the part of patients in
acute phthisis.
