PREFACE.


Hull our acknowledgments for the assistance he has
afforded us. When acting as House-Physician to the
Dispensary, not only did he discharge all the duties
required by his office in the most efficient manner possible, but also prepared the valuable tables of which
we have had occasion to make use in our work, besides giving us valuable aid in other parts of it. We
would also thank Mr. Adie, our townsman, and distinguished optician, for the weather tables which he kindly
furnished; and Mr. Alexander Bain, of the Board of
Health, for his kindness and attention in giving us
every information in his power which we required of
him.
We take this opportunity of informing all who are
interested in it, that we are now collecting materials
for a life of Hahnemann, and we should gratefully accept any assistance from those who have either had
the means of acquiring accurate information regarding
him, or who could favour us with any of his letters.
We shall not attempt any apology for the errors and
omissions of this book, or the blemishes and inaccuracy
in its composition, farther than that it was necessary,
in order to make it of any use, to prepare it with the
greatest possible speed, that it might be accessible
before the cholera lighted upon the country; and those
who know what it is to write a book at the intervals of
anxious business, and with the printing-press rattling
at one's heels, will be the first to make due allowance
for the imperfections of the present publication.
