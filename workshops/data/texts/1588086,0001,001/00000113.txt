ITS PATHOLOGY.


"With respect to the admission of a proximate cause,
there is much less approach to unanimity; and indeed the
existence of such a cause is in the present day very generally, but, as it appears to us, very injudiciously questioned.
In nine cases out of ten, a medical man, called on to define
a proximate cause of a disease, will reply that he knows of
no distinction between this cause and the disease itself, and
that, in his view of the matter, the terms are synonymous.
But this is to confound all distinction between what is often
hidden and what is always manifest, and implies a very
inadequate conception of what constitutes, strictly speaking,
a disease. A disease is analogous to a healthy function; a
proximate cause to the mechanism of that function. We
may recognise the one without knowing anything about
the other. If the discharge from the nostrils in catarrh, and
the yellow colour of the skin and eyes in jaundice, be distinct respectively from an inflammation of the Schneiderian
membrane, and an obstruction of the biliary ducts whence
these symptoms proceed; if what a person, ignorant even of
the existence of such a membrane, or such ducts, immediately perceives and recognises, be distinct from what a medical man arrives at only by study and observation; if, in a
word, semeiology and pathology be distinct sciences, a disease
is not identical with a proximate cause, but something resulting from it, and separated fromnt it by a very distinct line
of demarcation, It bears nearly the same relation to a
proximate cause which a shadow does to the substance which
produces it; and as the shadow is the immediate and evident
effect of the interposition of this substance, so as to intercept
the rays of light, whether the substance be obvious or not,
so a disease is the immediate effect of its proximate cause,
which, in like manner, may or may not be obvious; in other
words, it is merely an abstract term, by which we signify
