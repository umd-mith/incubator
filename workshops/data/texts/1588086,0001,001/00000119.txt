dying, the officers suffered comparatively very little. From a
number that could hardly have fallen short of three hundred,
only five or six deaths occurred; and it should be remembered, that at this time officers of all descriptions were
equally exposed with the medical men, for the sick had become so numerous, that even the services of all were insufficient to tend them with proper care, and duly administer
the requisite remedies.' Mr. Marshall states, that in his experience (in Ceylon) the commissioned officers were entirely
exempted.
s In this circumstance, however, there is nothing peculiar
to cholera. Commissioned officers are generally much more
healthy than at least European soldiers. This is particularly
remarkable with regard to the dysentery, or the particular
inflammation of the large intestines, which destroys probably
at least one-half of the Europeans who die in India in ordinary times, and in those parts where malaria does not exist
in any notable degree, a still larger proportion. From this
disease officers are almost exempt, even when it is prevailing
as a most virulent epidemic, as it often does in standing
camps in hot weather. I have treated thousands of cases of
it in soldiers, in these and all other usual situations, but
never saw an officer die of it, and rarely a serious case, or an
attack of it at all among them. This I have never ceased to
wonder at, and in seeking its explanation, have sometimes
been tempted to refer the disease to contagion.      They
are not so remarkably exempt from hepatitis. It is, however, chiefly referrible to the greater regularity of life of
the officer; for though he takes a considerable portion of
spirituous fluids, it is regularly and without inducing intoxication, whilst the soldier will be partially intoxicated for a
week or two together; and then, having no longer the power
of inducing that state-which is with him the summum boG
