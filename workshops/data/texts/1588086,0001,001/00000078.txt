year 1720, as affording useful instruction in all the points
we hold it of importance to bear in mind. Our chief authority is Russell's History of the Plague, and when no other
work is referred to, this clear and able narrative is the
source of our information.
According to Dr. Russell, (the author of the History of
Aleppo,) the plague raged with unusual violence in Syria in
the year 1819; and, as is usual in such circumstances, great
numbers had fled to the coast, and the sea-port of Sidon was
almost certain to have many of the infected among its visitors. It actually broke out there in the beginning of February

a few days after the ship had quitted it. There cannot be
a doubt as to the dreadful character of this vessel's freight
now. Notwithstanding her clean bill of health, the plague
