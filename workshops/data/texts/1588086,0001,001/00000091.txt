lie and the pilot (who had joined the smack near the mouth
of the river in Dunbar Bay) having been found on board by
the officers in the preventive boat, were obliged to proceed
with the vessel to the quarantine station. This porter, Murray, was cut off by the disease after an illness of only twelve
hours' duration.-8. On the 12th, another of the crew of the
Trusty was attacked and transferred to the Nymphe, but
recovered in the course of a few days.
" Thus out of the whole crew of the Trusty, ten in number,
one died of cholera at sea; a second on shore at Leith; a
third remained there, but recovered; a fourth, whose case
proved afterwards fatal, sickened while the vessel lay in
Leith roads. Three others were attacked in St. Margaret's
Hope, and sent on board the Nymphe; and of these three,
one recovered and two died. The porter who joined the vessel
at Leith also took the disease there, and died. The three
remaining members of the crew, and tile pilot, who came on
board in Dunbar Bay, had each an attack of diarrhoea.
" Of the five mariners who had acted as nurses to the crew
of the Trusty on board the hospital-ship, one was attacked
with cholera during the afternoon of the 15th, and died in less
than twelve hours. On the 24th, another of them was attacked
with nausea, vomiting, purging, and tenesmus, but recovered.
On the morning of the 27th, a third is reported in the ship's
journal as attacked with the premonitory symptoms of
cholera; but is entered as better on the 28th and 29th. On
the evening of the day on which the third nurse was attacked, a sailor was sent on board the Nymphe from a second
infected vessel that had arrived in the quarantine ground,
but up to that day only the men of the Trusty had, with the
exception formerly noticed, been on board of her as patients."
Dr. Simpson himself minutely inquired into the details of
this case, and guarantees the accuracy of the statement.
