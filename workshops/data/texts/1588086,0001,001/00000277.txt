Cicuta virosa, or water-hemlock, is indicated in cases where
the respiratory apparatus acts convulsively, as for example
where there is violent hiccough or loud belching. A dose of
it to. the amount of a drop of the second or third dilution
may be given to relieve this very painful and troublesome
symptom. We have seen it of decided advantage in such
cases.
Wepfer* has related the particulars of the poisoning of
several children by the root of this plant. In one of them,
Jacob Mider by name, who was six years old, the countenance assumed a dreadful expression, his teeth became
clenched, and he rolled his eyes about. " Hiccough was frequent, and he seemed to wish to vomit, but could not."
