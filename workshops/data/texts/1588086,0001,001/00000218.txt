ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


" As regards the treatment of these 732 patients, I differed from the general practice, with the exception of a few
cases which I shall afterwards allude to,* and, as the result
shows, I had no reason to repent so doing. I did so, not
from any blind zeal for a system, concerning whose truth or
falsity a bitter contest is going on-I was influenced by no
private interest, for I had previously refused to accept the
salary awarded me by the Government for my services; but
when I called to mind the diverse modes of treatment adopted
by innumerable physicians in all countries, as far as I could
ascertain these from their writings, I could not but look at
my position with anxiety; I could see no inducement to
tread in the ordinary well-beaten path; my duty, my conscience, urged me to try some other methods.  Strifes about
a theory-which could not be of such importance in this
case-I wished to leave to the arena of the schools, and employ only the practically useful, to the efficacy of which
many had borne witness, and which had been tested also by
myself in other diseased conditions, that so I might learn
what inducements the new way held out, the old one being
so unpromising.
"11On looking back to the results of this treatment, (and
the value of any mode of treatment is to be judged of from
its results on a large scale, since we have no other method
of forming a judgment,) on considering that more than onehalf of my patients were from a district (Wieden) where the
epidemic in 1831 and 1832 had been most severe, and had
had most victims, where this year it had raged for the
longest period, that this circumstance was not a little dis* " I treated four patients with calom. and jalap; two with acid. nitr. fum.;
four with sp. sal. ammon. caust.; six with muriate of soda, but all these died:
of forty convalescents, where the practice of both schools indicated the same
remedy, I gave it in Allopathic doses, yet without obtaining any result."
