ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


The general health of the native troops appears to have
been considerably meliorated in the last two years; while
a remarkable increase of sickness, independently of cholera,
has prevailed among them, coincident with that in the
European troops. By a reference to the meteorological
tables, it will be seen that the mean altitudes of the barometer and thermometer never differ, in a degree at all important, one year with another, from 1815 to 1821. According to the note at the end of the tables for the year 1820,
the barometrical mean of the five years, from 1815 to 1820,
corresponds exactly with the mean of the five preceding
years; and that the thermometrical mean for the same
period only differs by a degree and a quarter. The principal
variations distinguishing the years 1817 and 1818 are to be
found in the quantity of rain and the direction of the winds.
How far we are to connect cholera with these phenomena
must be judged of with careful reference to the mode of its
progress through the Peninsula. In 1817, the disease did
not appear; in 1818, it appeared in the most northern parts.
In some places the weather was then wet, in others dry; in
some, the usual periodical rains were prevailing. It progressed in all situations; and it had not extended to the
southernmost points till 1819, when the irregularities of the
preceding seasons might be concluded to have lost their
effects. After the seasons have been restored to their wonted
regularity, and, more lately, (1823-24,) after a completely
opposite state to that of 1818 has prevailed-to wit, a season
of unwonted drought, owing to the failure of the rains of the
NE. monsoon, cholera has still unhappily continued to prevail; sporadically, in all parts, and in the instances of many
marching corps epidemically, and with much severity and
mortality. If the irregularity of the seasons in 1817 and
1818, therefore, have given rise to cholera, we apprehend
