tion could'not be produced in some stages of cholera, because
the production of serum was, in common with the glandular
secretions, arrested; but when we reflect on the readiness
with which serous fluids are poured out in that disease, we
shall be rather disposed to refer the failure in the action of
vesicatories, even of hot water, to the diminution or destruction of the nervous energy of the skin. It is certain that,
in a body but just dead, the application of boiling water
will vesicate readily; and if the accuracy of the observation respecting its non-vesicating power in advanced
stages of cholera be established, we must infer that there
is less vitality in the skin in such cases, the patient being
still alive, than in that of a body recently dead of some
other disease.
"At a very early stage in cholera, leeches can procure
little or no blood from the skin. This fact is noticed by
some in another sense, as if these animals turned in abhorrence from the skin of a person ill with cholera. When the
sweat is thin, it is usually poured out, in large quantity,
from the whole surface of the body; but when thick or
clammy, it is more partial, and generally confined to the
trunk and head. The action of the vapour, and hot baths,
seem unquestionably to increase the exudation, or secretion
from the skin; and the application of dry heat, as thle natural
temperature of the skin augments, appears to restrain these
discharges-circuminstances not very compatible with the supposition of a state of spasm of the vessels of the skin. The
perspiration or moisture is often free from odour; at other
times it has a fetid, sour, or earthy smell, which has been
said to be peculiarly disagreeable, and to 'hang long about
the nostrils' of the bystander." *
