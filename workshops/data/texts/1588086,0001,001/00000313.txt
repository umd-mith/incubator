took also four opium pills between eight and nine o'clock, which
had been left by an ordinary practitioner for her sister and brotherin-law before their deaths; but the vomiting and purging, with
pains and cramps in the legs, at last became alarming. Some of her
neighbours, formerly patients of our Dispensary, having observed
the notices of our Dispensary being open at all hours, day and night,
for receiving application for medical aid during the prevalence of
cholera, sent there, and after breaking open the door, which had
been locked by her cousin while she went for the Parish Surgeon,
she was seen first about half-past eleven, A.M., and found in the
utmost destitution and poverty, without any covering or fuel, and
she was then in a state of collapse; pulseless, cold and deaf; lying
prostrated on the same dirty bed, which bore the marks of the alvine

and less frequent; they came on every twenty and thirty minutes,
chiefly in the feet and in the left leg and the left arm; the gastrocnemii and the sartorii were most violently cramped when she attempted to change her position. The cramps, the leaden coldness and
blueness of the extremities, the pulselessness at the wrists, with
bluish, cold, and flabby tongue and lips, the cold breath, and the dark
circles around the sunken, half-open, and turned up eyes, continued
for more than an hour, during which she vomited three times the
same clear watery flocculent fluid, with a frothy liquid at the close
of each vomiting ant a hiccough. She said also, that a gush of
