ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


ing a portion home, gave some of it to Mary Stacker, aged
eleven, and Anna Schedel, aged six years.
"The following symptoms appeared-in the three children who had eaten at dinner of the confectionary immediately after eating, and in the two who had eaten later some
hours after the indulgence:" Unquenchable thirst, headach, and giddiness, nausea, dryness of the mouth, frequent vomiting of a fluid, partly yellowbrown, partly blackish-green, severe tormina at the region of
the navel, suppression of urine, slight tension of the abdomen,
which was tender on pressure, obstinate costiveness with constant tenesmus, pain in the small of the back, with cold extremities, and cold sweat. After the vomiting had somewhat
subsided, nervous symptoms were superadded, of which the
chief were-very severe headach, slight delirium, tearing
pain in the upper extremities, and convulsive movements of
the lower, particularly in the calves of the leg, great exhaustion and somnolence, which, in the case of three children,
amounted to a comatose condition; the countenance was in
parts red, in parts very pale. The pulse in four of the children was very small, contracted, and slow; only in the case
of Franz Krakowetz, a plethoric boy, did I find a hard, full,
quick pulse, with redness of the face and dryness of the skin.
M. Stacker had six attacks of diarrhoea, and Anna Schedel
one attack of vomiting of blood and mucus.
" It is not necessary to mention the chemical process by
which copper, which must have existed in large quantity in
the confectionary, was detected.
" The children seem all to have recovered; but one of them,
three weeks after this event, was attacked by jaundice, and
another of them by a tertian intermittent fever, attended
with periodic diarrhoea."*
