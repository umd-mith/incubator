ITS TREATMENT-COPPER.

We do not look upon cuprum as at all a specific for cholera,
but as powerfully curative of one of the most distressing
group of symptoms. We cannot, therefore, believe that it
will be of much use as a prophylactic against the disease.
Indeed, we must confess that we do not think there is
sufficient evidence in favour of any prophylactic of cholera.
Of course there can be no harm in wearing a plate of copper next the skin, as some have recommended; but we are
inclined to believe that the taking of medicines daily to
keep off cholera may have an injurious moral effect, and predispose to the disease. It brings the subject continually
before the mind, and suggests the probability of an attack.
The fear of cholera goes to such a length in some persons as
to deprive them of sleep and all enjoyment of life.  In such
cases we should recommend the use of prophylactics, but

acting homceopathically in regard to cholera. If we had
used any protection when attending patients in cholera, it
would have been camphor. We do not think that a person
surrounded with a camphor atmosphere could be affected
with the disease. We believe its poisonous effects would be
immediately neutralized. The following casts, reported by
Dr. Beer of Vienna, are the best specimens we have met
with of the poisonous effects of copper:" On the 1st of April of this year, at eight o'clock in the
evening, I received a notice from a surgeon, that, in a certain
house, several children had been attacked with violent vomiting without any known cause. A narrower examination afforded me the following particulars:-At twelve o'clock noon
of the 1st of April, Anna K â€” n gave to three children, viz.,
