patients, not only relieved their sufferings and promoted
their recovery, but in so great measure lessened the anxieties
of their medical attendants, who have frequently and warmly
expressed their thanks for this kindness. There remains as
the fruit of these labours, not only the good which has been
already experienced in the cure of the sick, but a large provision for future use in the valuable details of all the cases,
which have been carefully collected and preserved in the
cholera books of the Dispensary."
We believe that in all the circumstances of the case, these
arrangements were the best possible, and if the cholera spreads
over England this year, as there is a great probability of its
doing, we should recommend similar measures to be taken
in all places where Homceopathic aid is attainable. Above
all, in London this should be done, and we trust that if the
Metropolis be visited with the scourge, that the British
Homoeopathic Association will show itself alive to the crisis,
and take the mast energetic steps to establish temporary
dispensaries in all localities where the disease appears. All
that is required to be done is to engage a couple of rooms,
to post up bills announcing the fact, and to secure the assistance of one or two Homoeopathic physicians, who should have
a sum of money placed at their disposal, to pay for nurses
to be left with patients and superintend the treatment; and
if possible at each dispensary there should be a resident
medical officer. We cannot for a moment suppose that the
wealthy and generous capital of our empire will refuse an
ample fund for all these purposes. The good which may be
done by it is literally incalculable, and if the friends of the
cause come forward in the handsome way they did here, let
it never be said that the Homceopathic physicians drew
back! Surely at such an emergency, when the lives of so
many are at stake, it would be most unworthy of any man
