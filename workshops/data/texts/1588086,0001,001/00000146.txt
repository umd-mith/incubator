ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


is one of those striking examples of localization to which we
formerly referred. The causes of this prevalence are to be
found in the fact, that never were men placed under worse
hygienic conditions than those living or quartered in the
Fort. For military reasons, the space given to the buildings
of both Europeans and natives is exceedingly limited; the
houses are densely crowded, and a numerous population is,
or used to be, compressed into a space inconceivably small.
Close to the European barracks are two dirty bazaars, which
have long been considered as public nuisances. A large
tank, which in the hot season becomes nearly dried up,
furnishes its supply of effluvia; and a very inefficient supervision of the barracks themselves till lately allowed the
emanations of a large body of men to furnish assisting conditions in aid of the poison."
The humid state of the air which precedes or attends the
outbreak of the epidemic, has been noticed by many writers.
Dr. Orton, observes,-" I have been personally informed
by an intelligent officer who witnessed the different attacks of the epidemic in Brigadier-General Smith's force,
at Seroor and other places, that they were always accompanied by a cloudy, overcast state of the sky, sudden showers
composed of large drops of rain, resembling those of a thunderstorm, and a thick 'heavy' state of the air, giving it a
whitish appearance; and whenever the weather cleared up
the disease disappeared. He particularly observed, that the
epidemic was invariably preceded and accompanied by a
large black cloud hanging over the place; and added, that
this had been universally remarked, and that the appearance
had even received the name of the cholera cloud. All these
remarks were made without any questions or suggestions
from me which could influence their tendency."*
