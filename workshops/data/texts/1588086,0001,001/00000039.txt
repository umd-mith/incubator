ON EPIDEMICS IN GENERAL.

" If we take into view the time in which the last plague
occurs, we cannot deny that we find something analogous to
it in a pestilence described by Minotoli. It is not material
whether it be allowed that the plague raged at so early a
period, or that another similarly destructive disease existed
in its place. The plague, he says, commonly makes its appearance at Cairo about the end of March or the beginning
of April. The miasma is communicated merely by contact.
Local causes, however, increase its malignancy; and even the
prevailing winds have an important influence.  With an uninterrupted chamsin, the plague increases frightfully, and
speedily takes off those who are attacked by it.
"Compare also the 'description,' where, in accounting for
the sickness, it is imputed mainly to the chamsin; and it is
remarked, that great inundations, which leave numerous
morasses, always precede destructive epidemics."
The sparing of the Israelites, wonderful as it undoubtedly
was, is not without analogy. For example, in 1827, the inhabitants of Gooty suffered severely from the cholera; while
the regiment which was there, and furnished guards to the
town, enjoyed perfect health. On a sudden this was reversed;
the soldiers were attacked, and the townspeople escaped.*
And Cardem, in speaking of the plague at Basle, says, that
it attacked only the Swiss, and spared the Germans, French,
and Italians who lived in the town.t  In the recent occurrence of the cholera at Tooting, the children were the only
sufferers; probably, however, in this case from improper aliment and other reasons, which do not apply to the other instances of the same kind. There are several similar examples,
on record.
We may thus perhaps conclude that in the earliest of hu* Treatise on the Epidemic Cholera, by A. T. Christie, M.D. 1833. P. 15.
