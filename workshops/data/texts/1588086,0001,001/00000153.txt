ITS PATHOLOGY-EXCITING CAUSES.

" Glasgow presents a total contrast. The city is built in
the bosom of a plain on both sides of the Clyde. There are
eminences covered with houses, where the best (so called)
part of the community reside, but there is no abrupt transition between their habitations and those of the poorest.
It is a level surface, going off at parts in inclined planes.
Here the cholera confined itself to no particular localities, it
spread generally over the whole town, affecting all ranks.
We believe the difference between the intensity and diffusion
of the disease in the two places to be sufficiently accounted
for by their relative topographies."
In speaking of the predisposing causes of cholera, we described the mode of cure of some of them; and here, too, the
question naturally suggests itself, can nothing be done by
draining, or other such means, to prevent the occurrence of
cholera? To enable us to reply to this satisfactorily, we
have purposely divided the observations upon humidity into
three classes: the first, the humid atmosphere; the next,
the damp locality; and the third, running streams. We
cannot prevent a humid atmosphere, neither can we dry up
rivers, nor would we if we could, but we can drain moist unwholesome soils about towns; and if these towns be not
situated upon rivers, they may remain altogether exempt
from the cholera. We know no better illustration of the evil
effects of a bad sanitary state of a town in giving rise to
cholera, or at least tending to its development, than what
was observed at Paisley.
It may be incredible, but it is not the less true, that a
considerable part of that town, which has always been distinguished for the industry and intelligence of its inhabitants, many of whom have become celebrated over all the
civilized world, situated, too, in a well-watered country, " in
the land of the mountain and the flood," should be so wholly
