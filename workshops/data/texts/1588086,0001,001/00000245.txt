ITS TREATMENT-ARSENIURETTED HYDROGEN. 223
the pains had abated, and the urine became clear; but there
was hiccough, an excited state of the mind, and a feeling as if
a great stone lay in the lower belly. In seven days, he was
much better. In the third week, the whole glans and prepuce became covered with little pustules, which were followed by small ulcers.  It was not till the close of the
seventh week that he recovered completely.-Dr. O'Reilly
has related the following case, which arose from the inhalation of hydrogen gas impregnated with arseniuretted-hydrogen, in consequence of the sulphuric acid used for dissolving
zinc having contained arsenic.  Mr. Brittan, a Dublin
chemist, wishing to ascertain the effects of hydrogen on the
body, proceeded to inhale 150 cubic inches of it. Immediately after the second inhalation, he was seized with confusion, faintness, giddiness, and shivering, and passed a stool,
as well as two ounces of bloody urine, but without any pain.
Pains in the limbs followed, and in two hours frequent vomiting and dull pain in the stomach. The pulse at this time was
90, the skin cold, and the voice feeble. Ammonia, laudanum,
and emollient clysters gave him little relief.  During the
subsequent night there was frequent vomiting and no urine;
the face became copper-coloured, and the rest of the body
greenish; there was tenderness of the epigastrium and hiccough; but he was free of fever.  On the third day, there
was diarrhoea, and still no urine; but the jaundice had disappeared.  On the fourth, the breath was ammoniacal,
and somnolency had set in. On the fifth, the skin became
again deeply jaundiced, and the face was oedematous; no
urine had yet been discharged, and the bladder, examined
with the catheter, was found empty. On the evening of the
seventh day, he expired. On examination of the body, two
pints of red serum were found in the pleural cavities; the
lungs were sound, the heart pale and flaccid, the liver indigo
