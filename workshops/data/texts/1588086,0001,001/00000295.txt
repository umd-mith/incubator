minutes, but not so a medicine which is suited to counteract
a morbid state of the blood. Hence what we should call
the intercurrent remedies given to relieve some special group
of symptoms, should not be so long continued as the radical
remedies, unless they mitigate the symptoms for which they
are given. The frequency of the repetition of the dose must
depend much upon circumstances. As a general rule we
repeat it very frequently every ten minutes or quarter of an
hour at first, and gradually prolong the intervals. But we
do not think it is possible to lay down any rules upon the
subject, and much must be left to the tact and judgment of
the practitioner; for there are no two cases altogether alike.
In regard to the treatment of the typhus fever which
sometimes succeeds cholera, we are thankful to say we
have had very little experience, and we do not believe that
when the disease is treated according to the homeeopathic
system, that it will be found at all a frequent consequence.
The medicines most recommended in it are Rhus toxicodendron, Bryonia, Belladonna, Aconite, Arsenicum, we should
also add Helleborus niger, Cantharides, and Lachesis. But
we believe that, like typhus fever, it will be found a very
intractable complaint, and that it is very difficult to form
a decided opinion of the efficacy of any particular medicines. The good which remedies effect is necessarily slow in
its operation, and it is hard to say how much is due to the
natural course of the disease towards a favourable termination, and how much to the curative action of the medicines
we administer. It may possibly be necessary to give stimulants in this stage, such as brandy and water or wine.
This must be left to the discretion of the practitioner.
