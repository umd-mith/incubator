Chirurgical Review for January 1849, expresses and illustrates the general opinion upon this point:" About 250 miles north-west of Madras, a range of lofty
hills, called the Copper Mountains, forms the western boundary of an immense plain. A spectator standing at the
base of the hills, and looking to the north and east, gazes
over a vast expanse of country, which, nearly as far as the
eye can reach, forms an almost uninterrupted and level surface. About six or eight miles away from him, however, a
rounded mass of rock towers up abruptly from the plain, and
breaks at this point the uniformity of the view. This is not
one of those limestone rocks common in some parts of India,
which are formed by the evaporation of water deeply charged
with calcareous salts. This rock is granite; about half a
mile in diameter, and some 500 feet high. On its bare surface only a scanty vegetation grows, and the soil at its base
is equally sterile and dried up beneath the fiery rays of the
Indian sun. Such is the rock of Bellary; and till within
the last three or four years, the European barracks were
situated in the Lower Fort, built on one of the inferior portions of the rock. There are no marshes, no rivers, no dense
and exuberant vegetation which may afford to cholera a
congenial soil; and yet since 1818 cholera has never for a
single year been absent from Bellary, and the place of burial
of each successive regiment bears sad testimony to its permanent and unrelaxed activity. And it is evident that it
is something connected with the rock itself, which has to
do with this development of cholera.  The disease hangs
about the Lower Fort, and rarely travels any distance from
it; it prevails severely in the barracks on the rock, in the
native town and bazaars immediately adjoining, but it has
almost uniformly spared the native lines and the adjacent
buildings which are situated some three miles away. It
