ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


Fceces.-Severe pain in the bowels, and frequent inclination to stool; constant involuntary discharge of fluid fceces,
occasionally mixed with blood.
Chest.-Difficulty of breathing; oppression of the whole
chest towards the right side.
Trunk.-Acute pain in the back, extending down the
thighs.
Extremities.-Lividity of the nails and fingers; uneasiness and stiffness in the limbs; lividity, coldness, and almost complete loss of power of motion in the legs.
Jatropha Curcas, or physic-nut, is said to have been used
with advantage by the Russian physicians in the recent
cholera epidemic. We have tried it once or twice, but the
results were purely negative. We know but little of the
effects of this substance. Percival says,* that a man who had
chewed twenty seeds of the plant became affected with violent vomiting and purging, loss of power, and spasms of
various parts; and Dr. Christisont- found fifteen drops of the
oil produce as much effect as an ounce of castor oil.
Digestive apparatus.-Loathing nausea; disagreeable burning sensation in the stomach and cesophagus; violent vomiting and purging, with rush of blood to the head; anxiety,
with burning at the stomach; easy vomiting of a large quantity of watery substances resembling the white of an egg,
attended with diarrhoea, (as if the contents of the rectum
would gush out like a torrent,) accompanied by anguish;
coldness of the body; viscid sweat; violent cramp pains in the
lower limbs, to such an extent that the calves look flat like
splints; violent, excessive evacuations upwards and downwards, attended with complete prostration, spasms, and
death; increased evacuations.
