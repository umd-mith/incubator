market-places in its vicinity. In like manner, it afterwards
advanced step by step up the Burrampooter, affecting, during its transit, the villages situated on both its margins.
From the mouth of the Hoogly, to its termination in the
Ganges, near Moorshedabad, the same peculiarity was observable. The shipping at the new anchorage at Diamond
Harbour, and along the whole channel, as high as the Hoogly,
was particularly affected, and almost every village adjacent
to its banks buried many of its inhabitants. In the Bhaugulpore district, the propensity was so strong, that the virus
scarcely ever spread into the interior, whilst it almost depopulated the low lands near the Ganges. Again, in the
autumn of 1817, Moozufferpore, and the villages along the
Gunduk river in Tirhoot, and the station of Chupra on a
branch of the Ganges in Sarun, were alone visited, while at
a subsequent period the disease was thence communicated
along the Gogra to numerous cities in the north-east quarter
of our territories.  From  Allahabad upwards, along the
channel of the twin branches there forming a junction, until
the river was lost under the hills, it wavered so little from
the line of those rivers, that hardly a town or village lying
remote from their course was brought within its influence.
Without going further over our old ground, let us briefly
state, that the same rule held yet more unexceptionably in
Rajpootana, through the province of Bundelcund, and all
along the Nerbudda to the numerous branches of the Chumbul.' "*

in the local rather than any other sanitary condition of the
