ITS MARCH.


33


days the disease had developed itself in all the arrondissemens; 459 had been seized, and 178 had died. Towards
the end of September, the disease was at its height, and
nothing but despair was depicted on every face. It was on
the 29th of the month, that, with a devotion which we must
all admire, at a time when it was universally believed that
the disease was highly contagious, and when all intercourse
between the infected parts of his empire was cut off, lest his
subjects should perish, the Emperor Nicholas himself came to
Moscow to calm the alarm and raise the spirits of its inhabitants, and remained there till the 7th of October. This
certainly is one of the most memorable royal journeys on
record.
In the month of October, there were 5532 cases, of which
3107 were fatal; and among these were many persons of the
highest class. In November, it began to decline, and continued to do so in December, when it seemed to pass into a
kind of general influenza; and rheumatic affections, which
are common at that season, began to prevail. The cholera
abated steadily till March 1831, when it ceased entirely for
a time, to break out again in the following summer.
On its first approach a manufacturer, who had fifty persons in his establishment, lost four by the disease; he immediately removed the rest to a house in a higher situation,
and from that time, there was no other case.
The small town of Tcherkisowo, situated close to Moscow,
and holding communication with it when the cholera was
raging, was not attacked by it till the month of November.
Thus it had lasted six weeks at Moscow, and committed
dreadful havoc there before a single case occurred in this
place, which lay at the very door.*
