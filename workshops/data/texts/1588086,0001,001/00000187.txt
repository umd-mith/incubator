fever, a common consequence of this disease. In complication of cholera with typhus, the spleen was slightly enlarged,
as in pure typhus, (very distinctly marked.)
Stomach.-The mucous membrane friable and soft, and
exhibiting very often spots of ecchymosis. In a third of all
the cases, undigested food was found in the stomach.
Small intestine.-At the commencement of the epidemic,
very aneemic; yet, judging by the condition of the swollen vasa
subserosa, which in some instances appeared as white, bloodless
cords, and in others distended with blood, a state of hyperaemia might be detected, as having immediately preceded.
At a subsequent period, throughout the entire small intestine,
and particularly in the jejunum, a remarkable hypersemia
was perceptible, and in protracted cases even pure blood was
thrown out (resembling bloody mucus.) An enlargement of
all the solitary glands, and the glands of Peyer, or rather an
engorgement of the adjacent villous coat, and of the entire
circumference of the intestine, took place to an extent that
is not observed in any other disease. Over the groups of
Peyer's glands this engorgement presented the deceptive
appearance of an exudation: the microscope, however,
showed the villi, and microscopic injection of the vessels
confirmed this. On drying such a piece of intestine, there
merely remained at the destroyed spot a whitish point, as
the contents of a solitary gland. Throughout the small intestine the epithelium was abraded, yet it covered in part,
like a tough coating, the subjacent mucous membrane. With
these changes there was always present the peculiar, pasty,
greyish-white, flocculent cholera secretion of the intestine,
(having an acid reaction, and containing a quantity of albumen.) Entire flakes hung down from the mucous membrane
of the intestine, and presented the appearance of a slough,
which, if squeezed out, proved under the microscope to be
