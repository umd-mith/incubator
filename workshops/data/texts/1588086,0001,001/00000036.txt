INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.


different from one another. They extended over both the
Old and New World, and are called by French writers La
Grippe, La Folette, and La Russe.*
The seventh plague was a tempest. We have before had
occasion to notice the fact, that atmospheric commotions,
attended with electrical phenomena, have in almost all instances been observed to usher in a great pestilence. In
lower Egypt, tempests attended with hail and thunder are
not uncommon.
The eighth plague was the locusts. We have already adverted to the increase-of insect life when epidemics prevail.
In the instance now under consideration, they seem to have
been brought in unusual numbers by an east wind, and carried off again by a west wind, which was of a very peculiar
kind, known at present by the name " chamsin."
The darkness which overshadowed all the land of Egypt,
probably arose from the blowing of this "chamsin" with
great violence, attended perhaps with some electrical phenomena, as in the instance thus described by an eye-witness:
" The sun, without being veiled with clouds, had been
shorn of its beams; it gave only a white and colourless light
more feeble than the moon. A reddish dusky appearance
filled the region. With wounded eyes and nose so filled that
we could scarcely breathe, we strayed from one another, lost

cloud of dust was driven in like circumstances along the
Lybian desert. It followed the mountain range; and when
we believed ourselves free from it, the west wind turned it
