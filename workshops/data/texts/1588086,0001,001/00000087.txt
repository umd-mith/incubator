IS IT CONTAGIOUS??


65


Had there been a Parliamentary Commission sent to Cyprus
in the year 1 759 to ascertain whether the plague was an infectious disease, it might have reported in the negative; and
had it qualified its report by the adverbs there and then, it
could have incurred no blame; for, in some places at least,
it hardly exhibited its contagious character. We may thus
learn, no opinion upon the contagiousness of a disease is of
any value beyond the time and place which afford the facts on
which the opinion rests. Because the plague was not contagious at Cyprus, or but slightly so at one time, it did not
thence follow it was not contagious at Aleppo or Marseilles.
-Contagiousness is not an essential attribute of any disease;
it is an accident dependent upon many modifying causes.
Let us now proceed to apply this lesson to the most important question, of the contagiousness of cholera. Before
investigating the evidence in favour of the cholera being
contagious, we shall briefly advert to the opposite view of
the case. In the Second Report of the Metropolitan Sanitary Commission, p. 56, we meet with the following sentences:"1st, That the disease, as it has recently appeared in Per.sia, in Trebizond, and in Russia, is unchanged in its general
character, i.e., from the former epidemic.
" 2d, That the more recent experience in Russia has led to
the general abandonment of the theory of its propagation
by contagion-a conclusion in which, after a full consideration of the evidence presented to us, we fully concur."
We are naturally anxious to know what evidence was
presented to Her Majesty's Commissioners, on which they
founded the gratifying conclusion that cholera is not contagious. The evidence is from the following sources:-first,
The despatch of Doctors Sapi and Borg to the Vice-Consul
at Constantinople upon the disease, as observed by them at
