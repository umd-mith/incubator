ITS TREATMENT.

dation!) and if they dare to tell them unpalatable truths,
they are immediately forced either to retire or to retract.
Dr. Forbes, the former editor said, he believed Homceopathic
physicians to be capable of recognising disease and incapable
of direct falsehood. Dr. Forbes was too liberal, he therefore
retired, and in his place we have this writer, who says, he
does not put the slightest faith in the statements of Homceopathists. Alas, for a profession which silences those who speak
the truth, and rewards those who conceal and pervert it!
It is much more difficult to obtain important data from
private and dispensary practice than from the results in
hospitals. There is such a variety in the cases called cholera.
However, there is one remarkable coincidence about the few
Homoeopathic practitioners whose own testimony we have
examined, and that is, that the mortality in their hands seems
to have borne a pretty accurate proportion to the average
Allopathic mortality, rising and falling with it, but always
keeping much lower through all its fluctuations.
Dr. Rummel, who is thoroughly to be depended upon,
states, in a paper read before the Homoeopathic Assembly
at Cothen, in August 1832, that the comparative results of
his treatment, and that of his Allopathic brethren, were as
follows:Cases.  Cured.  Died.  Remaining.
Under Allopathic treatment,  164  47   101     16
Under Homoeopathic treatment,  46  28   16      2
This gives a mortality of about 1 in 3 for the Homceopathic, and 2 in 3 for the Allopathic. The disease seems to
have been very malignant at Merseburg when Dr. Rummel
treated it, and he seems carefully to have excluded from his
list all equivocal cases.*
When the cholera appeared in Moravia, Dr. Gerstel, who
had already treated it Homceopathically, was sent thither, and
