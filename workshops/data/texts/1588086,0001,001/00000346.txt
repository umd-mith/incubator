CASE XLIV.*
E. G., a woman aged 35.-Habits temperate; previous health
good. Was quite well last night. She was taken ill at three this
morning, 23d October, with vomiting and purging. We saw her
first at three, P.M., the same day. Surface of the body cold; an expression of terror on her face; tongue and breath cold; no pulse;
moaning from cramps; complained much of pain at breast. She
had three or four doses of Arsenic, 3d dil., without any benefit.
Five, P.M.-Acid Hydrocyanic, 3d dil., every five minutes.
In about half an hour she exclaimed, " God be thanked, my heart
is getting better." Pulse perceptible, surface warmer.
Arsen., 3d dil., every quarter of an hour.
Eight, P.M. â€”Vomited and purged once; no cramps; complains
much of pain in sides and back; surface warm, and perspiring;
very thirsty.
Continue Arsenic.
24th October, six, A.M.-Soreness of body, especially of abdomen;
was easier from twelve to three. Pulse not perceptible.
Continue Arsenic.
Half-past eight, A.M.-In the same state.
Continue Arsen.
Three, P.M.-Pulse 120; vomited once; tongue cold; no cramps.
* This is a case of only partial recovery, for she afterwards died in the Infirmary, and of course it does not appear among the recoveries in the table; but
as it is interesting for various reasons, we have thought it advisable to include
it in our reported cases. She was removed at the express desire of the lodginghouse keeper, and probably suffered in consequence of the removal.
