to contagion. Let us try whether they suit the cholera.
The overland mail from India takes about six weeks to
reach this country. The cholera took thirteen years. It
would hardly have suited Sir Charles Napier to have been so
long on the road.
When it first broke out in Hindostan, it spread like fire
