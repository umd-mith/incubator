ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA.


who really believes that he can save his fellow-creatures by
administering Homceopathic medicine, not to make his
actions a confession of his faith.  We can only say for our
own part, that although the attendance upon the poor afflicted with cholera in Edinburgh was no easy or pleasant
task, yet it is one we should have been ashamed to have
evaded, and one which has given us more real gratification
than any professional duty we have ever engaged in. It is
not so often that the chance occurs of being able to rescue
life from instant destruction; and the pleasure derived from
the deed far out-weighs all the sacrifices required in the
doing of it. Let us hope then, and trust, that as when the
news of the disastrous field of Flodden came here centuries
ago, it united all the inhabitants of our ancient town to resolute, united action, by which the wall which still in part is
standing was built, men working with the sword by their
side, helping one another in this lasting memorial of the indomitable character of our nation; so thia great crisis may
unite all those who believe in the doctrines of Hahnemann,
to make an effort worthy of his memory, worthy of a far
more glorious vocation, which is no less than being fellowworkers with Him who gives ear to the "sighing of the prisoner," and " preserves those that are appointed to die."
