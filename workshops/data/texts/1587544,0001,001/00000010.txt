PROFESSOR IENDPRSON 9

prosecuted, your examination of the subject with a desire to
act fairly by it, I am far from admitting that you have succeeded in your object. While there is much in your paper
that is just, and a little that will be regarded as even liberal,
there is a great deal that is the reverse of both. Some of
what comes under this latter designation is, no doubt, the result of imperfect information--of views which, as you acknowledge, have been " suddenly and prematurely " forced
from you. A large account, however, remains that cannot
be regarded in this light, but which affords some curious illustrations of the psychological infirmity that often leads
men to exhibit doctrines which they dislike to as much disadvantage as they can, without absolutely affirming what
they know to be untrue.
To this infirmity I must ascribe the suppressing of expla.
nations that might lessen or remove an objection;--the ready
admission of whatever appears likely to tell against your
opponents; the prompt repudiation of everything like a presumption in their favour; and the recourse to denials or affirmations regarding points on which you are not entitled, by
your actual knowledge, to offer an opinion.
Added to all this, there are so many misrepresentations of
facts and doctrines, (so plainly stated by Homceopathic writers, that it is difficult to conceive how they can be misunderstood,) that it will be scarcely surprising should many, who
do not know you personally, doubt the possibility of their
being unintentional.
It is easy to perceive that you started on your inquiry
with your mind fully made up on the more important merits
of the case; and the following are clearly the " views relating to the general subject which have long occupied " your
thoughts. You have been long satisfied that the treatment
of diseases, according to the old system, was, for the most
part,, radically bad,-with some exceptions, simply powerless
as to the cure of diseases, and in many, if not in most, of
these exceptions, worse than powerless, positively injurious;
you were familiar, therefore, with the belief that the majority of the supposed cures of diseases, including acute inflammations and other dangerous maladies, under the old
system, were due to the power of nature acting independently or even in spite of the treatment; you had heard not a
little of the success of Homoeopathy, and the difficulty of
conceiving that the means you supposed it to employ could
act in any way on the body, suggested an explanation of
this success, which chimed in with your estimate of the
