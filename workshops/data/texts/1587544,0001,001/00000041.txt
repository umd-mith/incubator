symptoms of another medicine; and he acts thus in the
very reasonable belief that, when the distinguishing symptoms of one case differ from those of another, the difference
depends on some difference in their pathology, notwithstanding the general similarity of the cases. If he had any direct
way of getting at the difference in their pathology, in all
diseases that are closely related, as he has, by auscultation
and percussion, of ascertaining the different pathological conditions of inflammations within the chest, that way would be
much preferred by him in practice, to the less certain method
of selecting his remedy by external phenomena and sensations. Yet, in this preference, he would not be giving up
the law similia similibus; for, of course, the medicines have
their pathology (in order to produce the symptoms of the
provings) as well as the diseases; and all that is wanting to
make pathology the basis of Homaeopathic practice is, a correct knowledge of the pathology of both the diseases and the
medicines. Where that double knowledge exists, the Homceopathic practice is founded essentially on pathology,-as
in bronchitis, pleurisy, pneumonia, peritonitis, nephritis, cystitis, gastritis, dysentery, and many others,-the more variable symptoms of these diseases leading to the use of various
remedies, but only of such remedies as produce respectively
bronchitis, cystisis, &amp;c., of some sort, and with varieties in
the more important symptoms that correspond to those of the
remedies. Where such knowledge does not exist, there is
no help for it. If we know nothing more of the diseases and
the medicines than their symptoms, we must be content to
make the similarity of the symptoms of the one to those of
the other the rule of practice; and well does it answer; so
well, indeed, that in the great majority of those cases, even,
whose pathology is known, and known by experience to require particular remedies, the ordinary symptoms serve to
indicate these remedies to one who does not know the pathology of the diseases he is treating, as well as to one who
does.
In a minority of such cases,'however, the pathological
practitioner has the advantage; and I may illustrate the
statement by the example of pneumonia. When the complement of its symptoms has the usual amount and degree of
completeness, he who neglects auscultation can prescribe for
the disease as well as he who relies on the assistance of auscultation; but when, as happens in some cases of pneumonia,
the symptoms are very few, or of a nature that does not distinguish it from pleurisy or bronchitis, the former may be
