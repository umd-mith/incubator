PROFESSOR HENDERSON'S

as is known to all who are familiar with the history of
its progressive improvements within the last twenty years,
overlooks no pathological knowledge that can be of consequence to a practitioner of whatever school, and if there
would be anything unfortunate to medicine in its being received as one of the recognised methods of treating diseases,
on the supposition that it is partially true, the misfortune
would consist,along with others,in its furnishing the physician
with the means of treating diseases whose internal pathology
is avowedly unknown, (with a degree of certainty that he cannot derive from any other source,) by a careful study of what
is known of such diseases, and the application to that of the
H-ommeopathic principle of therapeutics. In your work on
diseases of the chest you affirm, " that there are many diseases of the pathology of which we are entirely ignorant;
and there is every reason for believing that not a few of these,
if really consisting in any change of organic structure, are of
such a nature as will never be exhibited beneath the knife of
the dissector; and though the progress of science since that
sentence was written has lessened our ignorance of pathology, you will not deny that the statements it contains are,
notwithstanding, still extensively applicable. In regard to
those diseases whose pathology is yet unknown, are we to
do nothing in the way of improving our treatment, little
satisfactory or creditable as it may be even when successful,
save by the fluctuating empiricism that tries this drug and
the other, without a rational guide or motive? Est ridiculum, (says the orator,) ad ea quce habemus nihil dicere;
qucerere, quce habere non possumus-at least for the present.
When pathology succeeds in doing any thing to remove the
darkness that still hangs over so many maladies, Homoeopathy will as gladly take advantage of the new disclosures
as your Allopathy can do; and if there be any degradation
in treating such diseases, till then, without the light of pathology, it seems to me to attach much more to the senseless
empiricism of the old school, than to the regulated method
(empiricism, if you please,) of the new.
As Homoeopathy, then, seeks avowedly for all the assistance that pathology, or an intimate knowledge of all that
can be known about diseases, can afford it, what is the
branch of medical science which it neglects? Anatomy and
physiology are necessary to the pathologist, and, therefore,
cannot be discarded by Homceopathy. Materia Medica, including botany and chemistry, are necessary to the distinguishing, identifying, and preparing of drugs, and, therefore,
