are of a nature that necessarily vitiates and invalidates his
claims to success as a practitioner, I may remark that the one
difference relates only to a hypothetical explanation of the
reasons why the high attenuations are capable of acting as
remedies, namely, whether it is merely that in a state of extremely minute division they are still capable of acting, or
that their activity depends on their virtues being augmented
and developed by friction and agitation;- and that the other
is a question which relates solely to the energy of their action. Modern Homaoopathists do not deny that the high
attenuations exert a remedial action in many chronic diseases; but they consider that the lower are preferable in general, because they act more speedily and energetically.
Similar differences of opinion exist every where among
other physicians, while they profess equally to be guided by
experience, and neither party is entitled to assume that the
mode adopted by the other is without its measure of success.
That Hahnemann erred on this subject, simply practical
as it is, was, doubtless, owing to his attachment to his potential hypothesis-an hypothesis which necessarily enforced
the employment of the higher attenuations, as signifying
the greatest degree of energy. Why he was so misled by
an hypothesis may be a proper subject for the derisive inquiries of those, if such there be, who have never been misled by hypothesis themselves, but have always walked by
the unerring rules of demonstration.
Men, who like Hahnemann, have discovered important
truths, and are endowed with an ardent genius, learn, it may
be too easily, to place implicit confidence in the suggestions
of faculties which had already penetrated far into new and
unexplored regions of science. They do not always wait
for the tardy steps of induction; but, as the history of
almost all the great discoveries, as well as of the great errors
of genius, declares, grasp by anticipation at conclusions which
future experience is left to confirm or annul. The latter is
much the more frequent result; and hence, if genius be the
benefactor of philosophy, " it is genius also, and not the
want of it, that adulterates philosophy, and fills it with error
and false theory."  Such being the frailty common to minds
of that class to which he belonged, it can be only ignorance
and injustice that would found on the acknowledged errors
of Hahnemann an argument or a sneer against the whole of
his system. The more especially that, from the very nature
of the subjects to which his hypothesis referred, many diffi
