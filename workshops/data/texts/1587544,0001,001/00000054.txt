PROFESSOR HENDERSON)S

each held to be constitutional affections, and any one of them
may persist for years, or for a life time, sometimes latent, or
lulled into inaction, sometimes betraying itself by more or
less considerable disorders of one kind or another. In the
treatment of these occasional outbreaks of disease, the prudent physician does not always content himself with seeing
them disappear, but follows up his treatment of them by
means that are supposed capable of improving the condition
of the system, of modifying or subduing the constitutional
evil.
Had Hahnemann admitted psora to rank but as one among
many constitutional taints that might from time to time discover itself by various local symptoms, I do not know that
any one would be prepared to convict him of error. Nay, it
is certain, that his opinion would be strengthened by the concurrence of more than one respectable authority. For it is
not a doctrine peculiar to Hahnemann, that the disappearance
of the psoric eruption from the skin gives occasion to other
evils of a more serious kind. One of his opinions is, that
the mischief to the constitution is less when the eruption is
abundant on the surface; and it is at least some excuse for
his notions on the subject, that when the persons affected
with the disease are enfeebled by chronic ailments, of one
kind or another, the eruption is much less considerable than
in the vigorous and robust, as Biett justly observes. He may
be wrong in having supposed that the chronic disorders of
such persons are due to the " miasm" of psora being thrbwn
in upon the system; but the two facts, first, that the eruption
is abundant when it affects the robust; and, 2nd, that it is
scanty in the feeble and otherwise unhealthy, form as good
grounds for his particular view of the matter as many of our
common pathological opinions regarding cause and effect can
boast of. And when it is further considered that such a man
as Pringle, not to mention earlier writers, avers that the
psoric eruption is sometimes critical, or appears on the surface
just when some serious internal maladies have ceased, and
apparently in a pathological connexion with their cessation,
we see some additional reason for regarding the doctrine of
Hahnemann on this subject with leniency.
I confess I have not given the subject so much consideration as to justify mein giving an opinion on the question,Whether psora is ever the cause of a constitutional taint
which may appear in the form of chronic maladies of various
characters? And I hesitate all the more to give an opinion
regarding it, that the question is answered in the affirmative
