PROFESSOR HENDERSON S

To my mind, if I viewed the subject from the same point
as you do, it would appear a very suspicious circumstance if
the original propounding of a system, so vast in its compass
as Homceopathy, had been brought forth in a form so seemingly complete and perfect as to admit of no alteration in its
theoretical principles and practical details; if, as the exposition of one man's opinions and precepts, however profound
his genius, it had received the unqualified acquiescence of
all his disciples; if its hypothesis had not met with opposition
among them, and its practical rules had not been modified by
their larger experience. The history of every great discovery
in art and science, of every new announcement, that proved
to be funidamentally true, would mock its pretensions and
throw aj ust suspicion on its adherents, if Homcpopathy, after
more than forty years' existence before the world, had
remained exactly as it came from its author. On the other
hand, I affirm that it is no small testimony to its truth, that
in no particular of essential consequence to it, as a rule of
practice, has the long period of its searching probation found
it to be false, (for the whispers to the contrary are too contemptible to be thought of;) and that where it has been
modified, it is in those very points where a large and varied
experience would have been expected to modify it; and that
there should be so general a concurrence, among the hundreds in almost all countries who have made it an experimental study, on the particulars in which it ought to be modified.
As early as 1824, Dr. Rau, of Giessen, published both his
high opinion of the Homceopathic treatment and his dissent
from the extreme and hypothetical dogmata of Hahnemann,
Since then, the moderate Homoeopathy, which employs the
lower attenuations for the most part-the very lowest, and
even the original or "mother" tinctures in some diseases,
more especially the acute-which administers them at short
intervals, even every hour in severe acute diseases-which
discards the psoric theory and the potential hypothesiswhich contends for the practical importance of the knowledge
afforded by the pathology of internal diseases, and for the
value of the most careful diagnosis, has grown up, and is the
almost universal Hommopathy of the present day. With all
this the Homeopathic law, the similia similibus principle,
the only fundamental principle of Homceopathy, remains the
motto and the maxim of this, the true-the only possible
" Young Physic."
Now, what is "degrading ' in this Homeopathy? You
