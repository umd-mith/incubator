PROFESSOR HENDERSON'S

which they are enriching their monographs and journals
without once mentioning his name.
While on this subject it may not be disagreeable to you to
be informed of a few other particulars of the homage that is
paid on the continent to the value of Hahnemann's contributions to the Materia Medica, and they will, doubtless,
receive the more favour with you that they are not furnished
by those who enrol themselves under his standard.
The same Professor (Maly) observes, of the Helleborus
Niger, after commending its use in dropsies of various kinds,
and other diseases, that " Hahnemann's proving of the medicine upon those in health, will be found the best guide" to a

I give these as samples only of the general estimation in
which Hahnemann is held by those who do not rank
among his followers, who cannot be suspected of a spirit of
partisanship, but possess honesty and information, and are
not enslaved by prejudice. Similar testimonies might be
easily multiplied, but I leave the consideration of those
acknowledgments which have been made of the importance
of Hahnemann's contributions to the details of the Materia
Medica, in order to notice, what is more cheering still,
because pregnant with the future recognition of all the.valuable parts of his system,-the acknowledgments of the excellence of some of his fundamental principles.
At the Scientific Congress held at Strasburg in 1842, the
Medical Section, with Professor Forget at its head, passed
the following resolution:-"The Medical Section is unani
