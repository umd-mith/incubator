PROFESSOR HENDERSON'S

same time I admit that the similia similibus principle do(c
not apply to the latent disease individually. We must bi
contented with having got our treatment of it in a roundabout way, and with finding that experience justifies its
adoption.
But a more important circumstance is involved in this part
of the subject than answering the question you have put.
It is this, that in every disease, of which the pathology is so
far known as to enable the physician to ascertain the nature
of the anatomical changes and morbid actions of the part of
the body which is diseased, the Hommeopathist regards them
as of primary importance in guiding his practice, and the
more remote concomitant symptoms of inferior, often of no
consequence to that end. It is thus that in pneumonia,
pleurisy, and other well-defined diseases, in which the condition of the parts affected are known and can be ascertained
during life, the remedies which the Homceopathist uses are
few, notwithstanding that the symptoms which may attend
such diseases are numerous and variable. He conceives the
more constant and characteristic conditions of the disease,
when these can be ascertained, to be the surest indications
fo; the treatment,-because denoting with the most certainty
the part that is affected, and the distinguishing peculiarity of
the affection. To him the anatomy and physiology of disease, when they are not mere conjectures or assumptions, but
ascertained truths, are of infinite value, and, therefore, he
regards pathology (in this its only scientific sense) as a department of medicine which he is not merely entitled, but,
for the progress and perfecting of his art, imperatively
required, to study. If he knew as much of the pathology of
all diseases as he does of those I have specified, he would in
every one of them, I have no doubt, find occasion to make
the pathological condition the more immediate object of his
concern, and the director of his practice; and would regard
such symptoms as were not necessarily connected with, and
indicative of it, as claiming little of his consideration. As it
is, he regards the most constant and characteristic symptoms
as alone of consequence in pointing out the proper remedy
in cases where the true pathological condition which causes
them is unknown. When he varies his remedy, in diseases
commonly considered the same, although their pathology is
unknown, or imperfectly known, he does so only when the
particular cases of that disease differ in such a way that the
symptoms of one resemble the characteristic effects of one
medicine, and the symptoms of another the characteristic
