come to know one another, and understand one another's
views and methods`'better than they do at present-when the
dusts of controversy have had time to settle and the atmosphere is clearer, they will find that they are not so very far
asunder as they at present suppose. Yet we may have many
a tough encounter before we "sheath our swords for lack of
argument,"-a prospect which we Homoeopaths rather rejoice at. We claim nothing but a fair field and no favour;
and are ready to fight it out, without a shadow of doubt as
to the issue.
The contest may be conducted as it becometh gentlemen
to contend, without the rash imputation of unworthy motives
-without appealing to the prejudices and passions of the
ignorant-without wilful unfairness, and without discourtesy.
You have set the example of an onset free from those degrading vices of controversy, and I trust that I have in this
defence been also successful in my endeavour to avoid them.
If not, I shall be heartily sorry for my failure.
With every sentiment of esteem, I am,
Your obedient servant,
WILLIAM HENDERSON.
