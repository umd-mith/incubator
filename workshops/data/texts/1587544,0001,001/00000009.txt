LETTER,
ETC.
SIR,-It is not the irritability of an author subjected to a
rigorous criticism that prompts me to address to you the
following remarks on your late review of Hommeopathy, for
I can say with sincerity that you have given me, personally,
scarcely any ground for complaint. Indeed, both as an
author and an adherent of the system which you have reviewed, I can justly pay you the compliment of stating that

the public are very seriously concerned. I gladly avail myself, therefore, of the apology for my interference which is
afforded by the circumstance of my having a place in your
review, in order to supply some of the omissions, and correct
the principal mistakes, of that article.
Though I give you full credit for having undertaken, and
