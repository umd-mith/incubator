at the time an increased sensibiliy in.the
part or tissue affected--therefore a minute
portion of such a medicine seems to act
and produces a gentle aggravation of the
diseased fibre or tissue, or influences the
dynamic influence--when they are in a morr
bid state they are more sensibly affected
than when in health-experience seems to
S  prove that a large dose of such a medicine
which is capable of producing an aggravation or over excitement, by which their sal1
S  utary influence is frustrated and their curative effects destroyed-and in many instan*
ces injurious consequences are produced-.
If the medical aggravation is carried above
the morbid one, or above a healthy state
and tone-then a reacting effort of the
functions of life will ensue, which disturbs
the calm medicinal influence, which it seems
best to avoid-large doses of medicine con'
tinued and repeated frequently produce injurious or poisonous effectsu and then the
S  whole plan fails, as the records of medicine
show.
