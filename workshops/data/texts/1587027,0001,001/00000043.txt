Tihe dose of medicine should be so small.as to produce only an aggravation, but less
in degree than the natural disease-when
the dose is large it would be likely to, and
does produce an   increased  excitement
above the disease, or a counteracting operation-then much or all of its curative
effects may be frustrated by a counteracting or suppressing influence.
In administering medicines on this plan,
it is proper to give but a very minute c'ose
of those specific remedies, so as to produce
a-gentle aggravation only at first, or a
quieting equilebrium in the system-or an
antidotal operation to vitiating or Psoric,
or poisonous material lurking in the lodyrather than a harsh irregular commotion or
counteracting  operation-Therefore  a
minute dose, which works out no injurious
operations nor poisonous effects, and that
does no harm even if they do not cure, are
'found to be the best and all that is necessa.
